Attention Span</a>&rsquo; after they asked for new blog feeds they could follow
on the fediverse and I realised I wasn&rsquo;t following their blog anywhere
— I&rsquo;ve since added it everywhere, including in my openring
configuration — and got thinking about a thing or two about my own
progress with ADHD over the last four-odd years since my diagnosis. I
do see something of an arc in my capacity for regular work and keeping
at doing different kinds of work, similar to what they describe, but
I&rsquo;m not nearly there yet.</p><p>I find that there are some things I can stay focused on and work
through. Sadly these have minimal overlap with what I&rsquo;ve chosen for my
career. I like working with computers — fooling around with R, trying
to learn e-lisp an figure out Emacs, and well, setting up this blog
too — and it&rsquo;s startling to see how little there is in terms of job
opportunities that involve any of these within ecology or wildlife
science. I realise I&rsquo;m digressing but the point I&rsquo;m trying to make
here is that I find that my attention span having improved applies
only to a very limited kind of thing.</p><p>It&rsquo;s been roughly two weeks since I ran out of my medication
(Methylphenidate — commonly known as Ritalin or Concerta) and I&rsquo;ve
been experiencing some withdrawal symptoms. This is the longest I&rsquo;ve
been off this since I got started some six months back. I&rsquo;ve had
disturbed sleep (I&rsquo;m writing this at midnight!), heightened anxiety
that often manifests as anxiety attacks, and in general rapid mood
changes and more but I&rsquo;ve also seen some things that were surprising.</p><p>The same kinds of work I thought I could do better has become a whole
lot easier to do now, while I&rsquo;m in this withdrawal state, for the most
part. I also find my thoughts to be clearer and that I no longer miss
out on important cues of various kinds. This is quite irregular but is
in no way sustainable in the long term for myriad reasons.</p><br></article><section class=comments><h4>post a comment to my <a href="mailto:~peregrinator/public_inbox@lists.sr.ht?subject=Re%3a%20Notes%20from%20a%20withdrawal%20episode">public inbox</a></h4><br></section><section><div><hr class="border-dotted border-neutral-300 dark:border-neutral-600"><section class=webring><h3>Articles from blogs I read</h3><small>Generated with
