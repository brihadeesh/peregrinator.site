releases out of which I&rsquo;ve listened to probably just handful of
albums. There was a <a href=https://putriddefecation.bandcamp.com/album/tales-from-the-toilet>toilet themed slam band</a> that put out something
with some really sick riffs. There was the album from Serein that used
a painting by Thomas Cole called &ldquo;The Voyage of Life: Old Age&rdquo; from
1942 as their cover art. Most people that checked it out, complained
that it had clean vocals, something not everyone appreciates in death
metal. This painting, however, was first used by Candlemass on their
phenomenal 1987 album <a href=https://peaceville.bandcamp.com/album/nightfall>Nightfall</a> and that led to some hilarious
reactions from people on Bluesky.</p><blockquote class=bluesky-embed data-bluesky-uri=at://did:plc:3ff4uii2g5w3bkew4y2iexcq/app.bsky.feed.post/3lfxa6yo7mk2h data-bluesky-cid=bafyreiccjfhiryxa4d6vyavb3zvosgcx7ecykpwrm2saeea7yiqfrohbl4><p lang=en>Very pleased to announce that I've narrowed my album artwork down to these four public domain options!

teenager&rdquo; and went on a rant about Christianity and posted something
pretty lame on his Instagram. And over the last two weeks, there have
been a bunch of fairly interesting death metal albums that came out.</p><h2 id=what-even-is-skramz>What even is skramz?</h2><p>What started as me just checking out something <a href=https://bsky.app/profile/adzes.bsky.social>Adzes</a> posted on Bluesky
went on to become a full fledged phase for me. It was Orphan Donor&rsquo;s
<a href=/blog/2025/01/what-even-is-skramz/#orphan-donor-old-patterns>Old Patterns</a> and it went from there to checking out a whole bunch of
what is called screamo or skramz. Now, I"m not entirely sure whether
the two are interchangeable and I haven&rsquo;t really checked but they&rsquo;re
all closely linked to hardcore and other *-core genres, grindcore and
crust. They often sound similar to each other but perhaps some
defining characteristics of the genre include loud riffs, short songs
and albums (not typically over 20-30 minutes long) and vocals that are
typically high fry screams. The vocals are delivered somewhat rapidly
with some slurred words so you really have to pay attention to catch
their lyrics.</p><p>What is really interesting abut the genre is the wide range of sounds
you get to experience within the genre. It is perhaps one of the most
diverse amongst metal and allied styles. Ranging from aggressive
grindy guitars and fast-as-fuck drums to softer melodic riffs to
abstract mathy songs or even the occasional slow, sludge-ey chugging
ones to the emotional and sad sounding kind. It is quite the
experience. If I&rsquo;m understanding this right, the variety comes from
the various stylistic origins for the genre, and it being a melting
pot of sorts, taking inputs from all over the metal spectrum, rather
than just a handful of genres such as with thrash for example, which
comes from just hardcore and maybe crust.</p><p>I remember how skramz and hardcore became something I was listening to
a lot more than the other metal I usually played over the last few
weeks since it helped cope with a lot of what I was going through. It
felt like I&rsquo;d finally found the right music for my prevalent mood,
especially in January of this year when I was in a very hostile place
with people I barely got along with. There was a sense of constantly
having to censor myself and behave in ways I normally wouldn&rsquo;t and all
the pent up resentment and anger at what I was going through, I could
only vent out through the experience of listening to skramz and
hardcore.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve found that discovery within the genre is actually quite easy
considering how popular it is as a genre and how many people post
about music they listen to on Bluesky. We also have frequent,
spontaneous discussions on things like how skramz and screamo have
become a regular part of what we listen to like <a href=https://bsky.app/profile/colinbwilliams.com/post/3lh5wbkobac2n>this one</a> from <a href=https://bsky.app/profile/colinbwilliams.com%E2%80%AC>Colin</a>
where I got to talk about my relationship to hardcore and skramz.</p><blockquote class=bluesky-embed data-bluesky-uri=at://did:plc:mvjetxlhl54i2dau6slwqwia/app.bsky.feed.post/3lh5wbkobac2n data-bluesky-cid=bafyreieq2oomuceajiubzyo32jovcjdcdqzd72t7quq676a7y5jue5u7vm><p lang=en>Honestly friends I‚Äôve been more skramz than metal these days I hope that‚Äôs okay</p>&mdash; <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:mvjetxlhl54i2dau6slwqwia?ref_src=embed">‚Ñ≠ùî¨ùî©ùî¶ùî´ (@colinbwilliams.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:mvjetxlhl54i2dau6slwqwia/post/3lh5wbkobac2n?ref_src=embed">2025-02-02T01:54:39.822Z</a></blockquote><script async src=https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js></script><p>However, I&rsquo;d like to highlight how some people have created feeds
exclusive to this and by just posting a skeet with the hashtag (or
even with these words) <code>#Skramz</code>, <code>#SkramzSky</code>, or <code>#Skramz</code>, anyone can
contribute to an ever growing list of posts that cover music of this
kind. <a href=https://bsky.app/profile/posttim.bsky.social>Tim</a> pointed two of these out:</p><ol><li><a href=https://bsky.app/profile/posttim.bsky.social/feed/aaacbrxni6bre>Tim&rsquo;s Screamo/Hardcore/Crust</a> feed</li><li><a href=https://bsky.app/profile/letsgetpivotal.bsky.social/feed/aaab3kjhsnl3a>the other Screamo</a> feed (by <a href=https://bsky.app/profile/letsgetpivotal.bsky.social>letsgetpivotal</a>)</li></ol><p>Other ways to find new music within the genre is to follow certain
labels. <a href=https://zegemabeachrecords.bandcamp.com/>Zegema Beach Records</a> and (I think) <a href=https://nofuneralsound.bandcamp.com/>no funeral records</a> are some
to get started with. The Zegema Beach roster is quite large and they
put stuff out very frequently.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of this, some death metal and some
hardcore and I&rsquo;ve talked about some of the highlights. A lot of these
are recommendations from various friends on Bluesky so if you&rsquo;d like
to hear more, these people are always talking about loud and screamy
music.</p><h2 id=what-i-ve-been-listening-to>What I&rsquo;ve been listening to</h2><p>This is a very rough list of music I&rsquo;ve come across, in roughly
chronological order of discovery.</p><h3 id=orphan-donor-old-patterns>Orphan Donor - Old Patterns</h3><iframe style=border:0;width:100%;height:120px src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4533026/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless></iframe><p>Being the first album I listened to while looking out for skramz, this
has become very dear over the last month. <a href=https://bsky.app/profile/adzes.bsky.social>Adzes</a> posted about this a
while back and I just picked it up. It appears to have a lot of
repeating themes within riffs that were melodic and created a kind of
emotional motif for all the songs in the album that really maintained
the energy of the album from start to end. Or, perhaps in simpler
words, the key and scales used for all the songs is quite similar and
so it flows from one song to the next smoothly. The sound is very
reminiscent of Mastodon&rsquo;s sound on Crack The Skye, with those
delicious sounding open chords and a very similar tone that perhaps
comes from a combination of chords overlaid with very stringy plucked
guitar parts.</p><p>The album was released on Zegema Beach Records in March 2020.</p><h3 id=orphan-donor-unraveled>Orphan Donor - Unraveled</h3><iframe style=border:0;width:100%;height:120px src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3044070440/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless></iframe><p>Orphan Donor&rsquo;s latest is quite unlike Old Patterns. It is somewhat
slower and with more anguished sounding riffs. It is definitely more
sludge/post-metal influenced with more droning guitars, simpler riffs
and some very quiet instrumental passages in songs along with feedback
on the heavier parts. The vocals too are emotionally dense.</p><p>The album was released on Zegema Beach Records in June 2021.</p><h3 id=frail-body-artificial-bouquet>Frail Body - Artificial Bouquet</h3><iframe style=border:0;width:100%;height:120px src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=364450411/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless></iframe><p>I have been hearing of Frail Body since quite a while back. I first
came across them in 2022. Now I can&rsquo;t remember if they were touring
with KEN mode or Chat Pile then but I just didn&rsquo;t play them until
recently when <a href=https://bsky.app/profile/garydavidson.bsky.social>Gary</a> suggested them to me along with Dreamwell&rsquo;s <a href=https://dreamwell.bandcamp.com/album/modern-grotesque>Modern
Grotesque</a> (also worth listening to for it&rsquo;s unique take on screamo.)
This is a more or less straightforward screamo record with fast,
chaotic riffing interspersed with more ambient post-hardcore
passages. The guitars have a sort of discordance to them in the fast
parts that makes the slower sections all the more epic and melodic.</p><p>The album was released on Deathwish Inc. in March 2024.</p><h3 id=city-of-caterpillar-mystic-sisters>City of Caterpillar - Mystic Sisters</h3><iframe style=border:0;width:100%;height:120px src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=843338322/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless></iframe><p>Mystic Sisters very nearly featured on my 2022 <a href=/blog/2023/02/albums-of-the-year-2022/>Albums of the Year</a>
article. City of Caterpillar released this album after about 20
years. This is more ambient and melodic which sometimes build up into
chaotic and dissonant sections. The vocals are not always screamed and
their songs have tense but melodic cleans as well.</p><p>The album was released on Relapse Records in September 2022.</p><h3 id=eyelet-the-devil-shining-out-your-eyes>Eyelet - The Devil Shining Out Your Eyes</h3><iframe style=border:0;width:100%;height:120px src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2675475659/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless></iframe><p>This is quite possibly my favourite out of the bands I&rsquo;ve come across
in the last month and it&rsquo;s some pretty damn good skramz too. Very
melodic, there are layered riffs. Starting with the rhythm which is
typically very groovey, there is a kind of lead that plays on top for
which there&rsquo;s a harmony too and all together it creates a rich
tapestry of sound. A lot of the riffs are catchy as hell too and
they&rsquo;ve really stuck with me even days after I last listened to this.</p><p>The album was released through the artist&rsquo;s own label in December 2020.</p><h3 id=eyelet-nervewracker>Eyelet - Nervewracker</h3><iframe style=border:0;width:100%;height:120px src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=40122527/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless></iframe><p>Being the older release from Eyelet, this album is rawer and somewhat
wilder than the later one. It&rsquo;s melodic too, with the same layered
approach to riffs. The vocals seem more emotional and pained.</p><p>The album was released through Fake Crab Records in December 2015.</p><h3 id=coup-d-etat-what-happens-after-the-epilogue>Coup d‚Äôetat - What Happens After the Epilogue‚Ä¶?</h3><iframe style=border:0;width:100%;height:120px src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3734378784/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless></iframe><p>Starting with a piano intro, the record quickly slips into deft
riffing that is not just melodic but very catchy in its groove. They
switch between screams and tight riffs and tense cleans accompanied by
softer, clean guitars. It is quite the experience vocally and in terms
of the music itself. The lyrics too are interesting and range from
political rants to quite personal matter. The aggressive, high gain
guitar tone too adds a sense of urgency to it.</p><p>The album was released through Yetzer Hara Records and Tomb Tree in
December 2024.</p><h3 id=crowning-oaktails-split>Crowning/Oaktails split</h3><iframe style=border:0;width:100%;height:120px src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2221778912/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless></iframe><p>I just want to take a moment to appreciate the cover art on this album
first. The sainted cat sparked quite a bit of awe from a bunch of us
on Bluesky and Tim mentioned another such: <a href=https://thycatafalqueuk.bandcamp.com/album/meta>Meta</a> by Thy Catafalque
which has a similar sainted cat on it.</p><figure><img src=https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0484003818_16.jpg alt="album cover for Crowning's Oaktails split"><figcaption><p><a href=https://crowningpool.bandcamp.com/album/oaktails-split>Crowning/Oaktails split</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>The EP itself was a great listen, and I kept revisiting it like much
of Crowning&rsquo;s discography but the addition of the Japanese screamo
band, <a href=https://oaktails.bandcamp.com/>Oaktails</a>, whose only other release is <a href=https://oaktails.bandcamp.com/album/what-i-think-what-i-love>What I Think, What I Love</a>
makes it very interesting. Crowning plays a kind of proggy, melodic
hardcore while the Oaktails side is more ambient and atmospheric with
very sad sounding, angsty vocals.</p><p>This was released through Zegema Beach Records in October 2024</p><h3 id=—è—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å--yasnost--–º–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–µ-–º–æ—Ä–µ>–Ø—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å (Yasnost) - –ú–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–µ –º–æ—Ä–µ</h3><iframe style=border:0;width:100%;height:120px src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2832940389/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless></iframe><p>This was on my 2023 end-of-year list and back then I only barely knew
this to be screamo. It was just an album I&rsquo;d discovered on some
streaming service I was using in the autoplay after playing an album
from KEN mode I was really obsessed with. It must have been either
<a href=https://kenmode.bandcamp.com/album/null>Null</a> or <a href=https://kenmode.bandcamp.com/album/void>Void</a>, I can&rsquo;t remember which. The album plays out quite
smoothly, it&rsquo;s almost as if it&rsquo;s one song split into seven. The riffs
are intense and melodic. It is a tranquil and surprisingly <em>happy</em>
sounding album and the lyrics (or the English translations they&rsquo;ve
provided) are almost abstract.</p><p>The album was released on Zegema Beach Records in January 2023.</p><h3 id=me-and-him-call-it-us-loss>me and him call it us - Loss</h3><iframe style=border:0;width:100%;height:120px src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1258006007/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless></iframe><p>This was one of <a href=https://bsky.app/profile/faithhealer.bsky.social>Faith Healer</a>&rsquo;s recommendations. He&rsquo;d also suggested
Dead in the Dirt along with this which I&rsquo;ve talked about <a href=/blog/2025/03/what-even-is-skramz/#dead-in-the-dirt-the-blind-hole>later on</a> in
this article. This is an incredibly chaotic and dissonant sounding
grindy record which just hits you with some of the sickest mathy
riffs, panic chords, very grindcore-esque drums and really loud
screams. Blake Connally, who performs guitars on this also went on to
form Dead in the Dirt and <a href=https://infernalcoil.bandcamp.com>Infernal Coil</a>, one of my favourite death
metal bands.</p><p>This album was released on Stickfigure Recordings in Jan 2006 but I

this is one of the best I&rsquo;ve come across. Tim and (I think) <a href=https://bsky.app/profile/neuronaraka.bsky.social>B</a>
mentioned this a few times and I checked it out after that. <a href=https://bsky.app/profile/av4apod.bsky.social>&mldr;And
Vol. 4 All</a> wrote a <a href=https://musipediaofmetal.blogspot.com/2023/02/reviews-stormo-ddent-sermon-cadaver.html>review</a> for it too. The most startling feature of
the record were the vocals which were a very different kind of scream
from most of the others I&rsquo;ve come across in the genre. They were very
full-throated mids to highs, and made the record a very interesting
listen. I hadn&rsquo;t realised this the first time I&rsquo;d played it but it
also features microtonal guitar parts too, which makes it an even more
curious listening experience.</p><p>They have a new full-length that releases <a href=https://stormo.bandcamp.com/album/tagli-talee-2>March 21</a>!</p><p>The album was released through Prosthetic Records in February 2023.</p><h3 id=athousandangelsandseven-athousandangelsanseven>athousandangelsandseven - athousandangelsanseven</h3><iframe style=border:0;width:100%;height:120px src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3339183858/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless></iframe><p>If chugging mathy riffs is your thing, this EP is for you. It has not
just piercing screams but anguished semi-clean vocals. The arrangement
is primarily in a mathcore format and it&rsquo;s got all of the stuff: panic
chords, chromatic sections and just generally chaos.</p><p>The album was released through Zegema Beach Records in January 2025.</p><h3 id=gospel-the-moon-is-a-dead-world>Gospel - the moon is a dead world</h3><iframe style=border:0;width:100%;height:120px src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2148414276/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless></iframe><p>Very proggy and atmospheric screamo. It was another of Faith Healer&rsquo;s
recommendations and as I listen to it again, I feel like it needs many
more listens. The guitar work is immaculate and it&rsquo;s riffs galore and
the drums really match up in every way. There are melodic passages
overlaid over feedback, a loud bass, and a sort of cinematic score in
the background, seemingly played on the guitars themselves. The blend
of progressive rock and hardcore with the powerful melodies makes it a
very curious listen. Being their debut release, it was the band&rsquo;s only
release from when the band was together initially.</p><p>The album was released through Level Plane Records in May 2005.</p><h3 id=envy-a-dead-sinking-story>Envy - A Dead Sinking Story</h3><iframe style=border:0;width:100%;height:120px src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2644120291/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless></iframe><p>Japanese band Envy played this album with three guitarists apparently
and it is epic. The guitars play soaring melodies interspersed with
soft, mellow clean sections. The songs are sorrowful and
poignant. They also seem to have oddly long songs unlike most
skramz. There are a lot of post-rock elements to the record too making
this a very close favourite.</p><p>The album was released through Level Plane Records in August 2003.</p><h2 id=other-non-skramz-stuff-i-checked-out>Other non-skramz stuff I checked out</h2><h3 id=frothing-vile-and-debased>Frothing - Vile and Debased</h3><iframe style=border:0;width:100%;height:120px src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1294017689/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless></iframe><p><a href=https://bsky.app/profile/sublation.bsky.social>Max</a> from <a href=https://sublation.bandcamp.com>Sublation</a> announced that he had played a guitar solo for this

on music also performs an &ldquo;unhinged&rdquo; solo on this. It is a sort of
techy, brutal death metal project with a lot of weird stuff
happening. What&rsquo;s even more interesting is that this album was

powerful and angry. Blending grindcore, hardcore and the occasional

are to do with things like religion and bigotry too. Faith Healer
recommended this too, like I&rsquo;ve mentioned before and it has very
easily become one of my most played albums of the last month.</p><p>The album was released through Southern Lord Recordings in August 2013.</p><h3 id=anaal-nathrakh-hell-is-empty-and-all-the-devils-are-here>Anaal Nathrakh - Hell Is Empty, and All the Devils Are Here</h3><iframe style=border:0;width:100%;height:120px src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=492997819/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless></iframe><p>Do I really have to tell you anything about Anaal Nathrakh?

grindy, industrial black metal just whips. I will forever be a Mick
Kenney fan. I hope to do a discography run soon so I hopefully will
write more on the article that follows that.</p><p>The album was released through FETO Records in October 2007.</p><h3 id=sicarius-serenade-of-slitting-throats>Sicarius - Serenade of Slitting Throats</h3><iframe style=border:0;width:100%;height:120px src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4261813520/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless></iframe><p>Being a Mick Kenney production, you can bet anything on how this
sounds. It&rsquo;s black metal, but it&rsquo;s also got a good amount of grindcore
in it making it sound very reminiscent of earlier Anaal
Nathrakh. Needless to say, it feels angry and is replete with
blastbeats from start to finish. The vocals are pushed though some
kind of distortion making them all the more intense.</p><p>The album was released independently in October 2017.</p><p>Well, that&rsquo;s it for this time. I hope to write more such pieces
covering stuff I generally listen to along with newer releases from
small projects that caught my attention.</p><br></article><section class=comments><h4>Join the conversation on
