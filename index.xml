mostly since it comes with most Linux distributions&amp;rsquo; own package
repositories. It was around the same time that I decided that I
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t use Chrome because of all the ways in which it collects and
abuses personal data&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Recent events with Mozilla that have changed the way Firefox
handles data have left me concerned about whether the browser is still
&amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo; than Chrome in that regard. My doubts started with actually a
meme that was circling around on Twitter that a friend had retweeted
about a diff in the source code for Firefox.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is one of the wildest git diffs I&amp;#39;ve ever seen &lt;a href="https://t.co/MJjzyZ8WUn">pic.twitter.com/MJjzyZ8WUn&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Theo - t3.gg (@theo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/theo/status/1895630175939019125?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2025&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>


&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://peregrinator.site/images/firefox_diff.jpg"
 alt="a diff showing the removal of an FAQ item regarding whether personal data is sold by Firefox">&lt;figcaption>
 &lt;p>a screenshot of a diff from the source code of Firefox, from the tweet above&lt;/p>
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>

&lt;p>This was followed by allegedly, various changes in their terms of use
regarding how they use personal data entered on websites while using
the browser amongst which they basically admit to selling personal
data in some form or the other&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>
which is something I could never stand for. This, along with a bunch
of features I don&amp;rsquo;t really use — their obsession with AI, which is
quite obvious in their release notes with recent releases — have made
me increasingly uncomfortable with the whole idea of continuing to use
Firefox. I don&amp;rsquo;t actually know what changes they&amp;rsquo;ve made off-late and
I obviously don&amp;rsquo;t have the time to go through the changes at the
source level (if I could even understand what was happening.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve basically gotten so used to using most of the other features on
the browser such as syncing and migrating to a new device by just
logging into the browser that I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I can find a new browser
that will really work for me the same way.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="firefox-forks-chrome-forks">Firefox forks? Chrome forks?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have no qualms using forks of Firefox itself that have better
privacy. &lt;a href="https://librewolf.net">Librewolf&lt;/a> is a privacy focused fork that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen mentioned
in a lot of places. Void Linux doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer a package for this
although there is a repo with a &lt;a href="https://github.com/index-0/librewolf-void">build template&lt;/a> for it. I actually
tried to run this build on my laptop but it ended up freezing up
everything. It has sync disabled by default which I think I&amp;rsquo;m okay
with anyway since it&amp;rsquo;s a Firefox service, although they apparently
encrypt data. But then I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether it&amp;rsquo;s really any better
than Firefox. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are more such forks for both Android (I
remember using &lt;a href="https://github.com/Divested-Mobile/Mull-Fenix">Mull&lt;/a> which is apparently orphaned now, there was also
Fennec and some others I tried) and Linux.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://arc.net/">Arc Browser&lt;/a> seems like a good choice for Windows and I&amp;rsquo;ve been using
it instead of Chrome for various work-related stuff. It&amp;rsquo;s not a
Firefox fork, clearly, and they don&amp;rsquo;t have Linux packages either and I
believe this is a fork of Chrome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are there really any alternatives that work as well as Firefox did,
without the AI bloat and everything else that&amp;rsquo;s wrong with it?&lt;/p>

the source code for the blog last month and talked about why Sourcehut
builds and the &lt;a href="https://srht.site/limitations">restrictions&lt;/a> on content were my primary motive. I also
mentioned the changes I&amp;rsquo;d made to the website itself, including the
Bluesky comments section I&amp;rsquo;d added to posts. I, however, had second
thoughts about the whole move, what with the new theme and all its
fancy features, very few of which I actually used and how the shift
back to Github meant that I was giving up on the completely open
source services offered by Sourcehut for the not-very transparent
service offered by Github.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/jpanther/congo">The theme&lt;/a> looked nice, with all the soft pastel colours and the fancy
CSS but I had really not had a chance to go through most of the code
myself. Going back to the theme&amp;rsquo;s repo, I see now that there is a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ajpanther%2Fcongo&amp;#43;&amp;#43;language%3AJavaScript&amp;amp;type=code">little bit of JavaScript&lt;/a> too. Now, it&amp;rsquo;s not that &lt;em>all&lt;/em> JS is bad but
when I&amp;rsquo;d started this website and blog, I&amp;rsquo;d decided that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t
use any of it, especially for wholly unnecessary things such as
appearances because I just am not familiar enough with it. I just
wanted a very basic, functional site which was lightweight and easy to
maintain. So I set out again, scouting for themes that seemed to offer
this — a minimal look and something very basic I could build on — and
came across a few.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini">Mini&lt;/a> seemed like something easy to work with and I gave it a shot but
it turned out to be really badly maintained and a lot of it wasn&amp;rsquo;t
updated to work with newer Hugo versions. I saw that the repo had
multiple open pull requests for fixes that just hadn&amp;rsquo;t been looked at
by the maintainer. And it just kept throwing errors every time I tried
to run a local Hugo server to see if it worked. I actually ended up
spending most of my time fixing them. It also didn&amp;rsquo;t have a dark
theme, something which I would&amp;rsquo;ve liked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch/">Etch&lt;/a> was a theme I&amp;rsquo;d tried out when I initially started out with this
blog, after switching to Hugo and my whole Emacs-based setup. I had
discarded it for something based off &lt;a href="https://drewdevault.com/">Drew&amp;rsquo;s website&lt;/a>. But looking at
&lt;a href="https://neilzone.co.uk/">Neil&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a>, which I&amp;rsquo;d come across while searching for something, I
realised that I could make this work. It was just after I&amp;rsquo;d put in the
final touches on the Congo theme setup that I got the pangs to go back
to a ridiculously simple theme such as this. I took a while to make up
my mind and then made the jump after showing it in action to a few
people.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="changes-to-the-theme">Changes to the theme&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I had made a few changes to make the theme work for me. It had a
landing page that listed out all posts but it used a very odd set of
layouts for this. An &lt;code>index.html&lt;/code> template that called the &lt;code>posts.html&lt;/code>
partial which in turn used a ridiculously simple code that had &lt;code>li.html&lt;/code>
from &lt;code>/layouts/_defaults/&lt;/code> render a list of posts. I modified the
&lt;code>posts.html&lt;/code> template such that the list generated would organise posts
by year of publishing, in an &amp;ldquo;archives&amp;rdquo; sort of fashion. I didn&amp;rsquo;t like
how the article date was part of the link too so I moved it out of the
&lt;code>&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code> tag.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> &lt;span class="p">&amp;lt;/&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nt">li&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">&amp;gt;&lt;/span>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="p">&amp;lt;/&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nt">ul&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="p">&amp;lt;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nt">br&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">{{- end }}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I also didn&amp;rsquo;t like the default date format so I changed it by added
&lt;code>/i18n/en.toml&lt;/code> with dates formatted in my preferred style. This is
actually part of the theme&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch/wiki/i18n">wiki&lt;/a>. I also added a layout for the
&lt;a href="https://peregrinator.site/fiction/">fiction&lt;/a> section that was more-or-less like the default but with the
date on the list outside the hyperlink tag like with the template for
the homepage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I added a very basic &amp;ldquo;info&amp;rdquo; line indicating posts that were part of
series on the top of articles (it was called in the &lt;code>single.html&lt;/code>
template). The series template I ended up using was ridiculously
simple unlike the ones I found online which had too many features like
those that listed out articles in the series, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like
I needed, considering that the theme already generated a list of these
in the taxonomies.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">{{ if .Params.series }}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="p">&amp;lt;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nt">div&lt;/span> &lt;span class="na">class&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s">&amp;#34;info&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> &lt;span class="p">&amp;lt;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nt">p&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">&amp;gt;&lt;/span>This article is part of the &lt;span class="p">&amp;lt;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nt">a&lt;/span> &lt;span class="na">href&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">=&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s">&amp;#34;/series/{{ .Params.series | urlize }}&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">&amp;gt;&lt;/span>{{ .Params.series }}&lt;span class="p">&amp;lt;/&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nt">a&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">&amp;gt;&lt;/span> series.&lt;span class="p">&amp;lt;/&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nt">p&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="p">&amp;lt;/&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nt">div&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">{{ end }}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I was on the fence about comments, which was a crucial part of why I&amp;rsquo;d
moved to Github, but I settled for a very basic link to the Bluesky
post and a link to reply to the post to my public inbox which I&amp;rsquo;d set
up a while back on Sourcehut lists. I think I&amp;rsquo;m happy with how this
looks now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I added the &lt;a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/openring">openring&lt;/a> template from earlier, making it very simple and
without almost any formatting (I even removed a bunch of styling
elements I&amp;rsquo;d worked on from the CSS). Finally, I added a header-like
footer menu to display important social links and added a link to my
newly created &lt;a href="https://peregrinator.site/privacy/">privacy&lt;/a> page that basically talks about how I respect
everyone&amp;rsquo;s privacy and don&amp;rsquo;t offer cookies and the like. The RSS link
is also down there now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The font is as always, &lt;a href="https://github.com/samvk/monorale-raleway-sober">Monorale&lt;/a> and the code blocks have Prot&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes">Modus&lt;/a>
theme, like what I had on my own Emacs until recently.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="issues-with-sourcehut-builds">Issues with Sourcehut builds&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I had initially tested this out on the Sourcehut page that I got with
my account and encountered a weird issue while building the
site. Sourcehut builds would get stuck at the same point every time I
pushed a commit to the repo — it was &lt;a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sr.ht-discuss/%3CtMVFgp8GaDoesSDCvSDPa67dbKRxx-o-UWlVVDLBrMNkp3m-hGsMLU1bJ1wd4GE7rHjk8OzLU7Tex0Ko9e5jGM1Y5qu52Sb-ODc_drZDsXk=@protonmail.com%3E">while openring was being run&lt;/a> —
and I testing a few things out with this. It looks like it&amp;rsquo;s got to do
with feeds from WordPress blogs and I think it&amp;rsquo;s because RSS feeds
from those aren&amp;rsquo;t part of the blogs themselves and rather seem to be
files that are downloaded. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be an issue if I run
the openring command from my terminal emulator or on Github and so I&amp;rsquo;m
sticking to it for now, atleast until we find a fix for this on
Sourcehut builds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, that&amp;rsquo;s it for now. I hope to get back to writing that article
I&amp;rsquo;d started on skramz last month but at this point, I have no idea
when that&amp;rsquo;ll be ready.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Sourcehut builds dilemma</title><link>https://peregrinator.site/blog/2025/02/the-sourcehut-builds-dilemma/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:32:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://peregrinator.site/blog/2025/02/the-sourcehut-builds-dilemma/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been deploying this blog using Sourcehut builds from my Sourcehut
repo for some time now but I&amp;rsquo;ve started to have doubts about whether I
want to stick to this given the &lt;a href="https://srht.site/limitations">limitations&lt;/a> on Sourcehut pages. I&amp;rsquo;ve
not had to thing about this a lot until recently since I also switched
up my Hugo theme to &lt;a href="https://github.com/jpanther/congo">Congo&lt;/a>, which has a few additional features. These
in turn inspired me to incorporate comments from Bluesky too but this
didn&amp;rsquo;t work on the version of this site deployed from my &lt;a href="https://git.sr.ht/~peregrinator/peregrinator.site">Sourcehut
repo&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;ve anyway been working on other things on the blog so I
decided to fix this and rearrange how I present the blog a little
while at it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now the blog is split into two parts: the main blog, of which you
can see articles like this one, and the &lt;a href="https://emacs.peregrinator.site/">Emacs blog&lt;/a> on a
subdomain. This part of the blog is hosted on my Github and deploys
with Github Pages to allow Bluesky comments adopted from &lt;a href="https://kau.sh/blog/bluesky-comments-for-hugo/">Kaushik
Gopal&amp;rsquo;s blog post&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="comments-from-bluesky">Comments from Bluesky&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It has a very basic setup. There is a &lt;a href="https://github.com/brihadeesh/peregrinator.site/blob/main/layouts/partials/comments.html">&lt;code>comments.html&lt;/code>&lt;/a> partial in
&lt;code>~/layouts/partials/&lt;/code> that basically just references a JavaScript script
at &lt;code>~/assets/js/bsky-comments.js&lt;/code>. The comments partial is as displayed
below. It is a very basic HTML script with Tailwind CSS built in.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my &lt;a href="https://peregrinator.site/about/">about page&lt;/a> with a little more about myself and my
publications. There are now photos of Goose, my cat, too. I am
considering putting up a gallery of some of my photos on this
site. Perhaps as a subdomain like with my Emacs blog. There&amp;rsquo;s
hopefully a lot more to come!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In other news, I&amp;rsquo;ve moved to a new theme for the blog. I now use a
fully personalised version of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/jpanther/congo">Congo&lt;/a> theme. So now there&amp;rsquo;s an
optional dark theme too. The blog also uses a new typeface: &lt;a href="https://github.com/samvk/monorale-raleway-sober">Monorale&lt;/a>,
a font based on &lt;a href="https://github.com/impallari/Raleway">Raleway&lt;/a>. I find it a lot more comfortable for reading
online.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>No more EOY lists for music</title><link>https://peregrinator.site/blog/2025/01/no-more-eoy-lists-for-music/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 20:23:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://peregrinator.site/blog/2025/01/no-more-eoy-lists-for-music/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote for the blog and even longer since I
made an end-of-year list but I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about these
lists. I&amp;rsquo;ve published just one from a &lt;a href="https://peregrinator.site/blog/2023/02/albums-of-the-year-2022.html">couple of years back&lt;/a> and then
never really published one on the blog and it has been something of a
conscious decision. I would perhaps like to move towards writing more
meaningful pieces on individual albums or sets of albums I&amp;rsquo;ve been
listening to and have gotten to appreciate. Making EOY lists has been
exhausting and I&amp;rsquo;m never entirely sure if I&amp;rsquo;ve missed out on any
albums since I don&amp;rsquo;t really keep track of what I really enjoyed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In that vein, I&amp;rsquo;d perhaps like to talk about what I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening
to off-late. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bit of a break from work and things have
gotten tedious in the place I&amp;rsquo;ve been living in for the last few
months. Having to put up with people I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to be around
and getting endless unsolicited advice has left me frustrated. And so
I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of RABM and, in general, black metal such
as Mare Cognitum and Paysage d&amp;rsquo;Hiver. Also peep the new and upcoming
Bandcamp replacement, &lt;a href="https://ampwall.com">Ampwall&lt;/a> which &lt;a href="https://ampwall.com/u/clg666">Chris Grigg&lt;/a> has been developing.&lt;/p>

&lt;/iframe>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://paysagedhiver.bandcamp.com">Paysage d&amp;rsquo;Hiver&lt;/a> has been especially dear to me since I discovered them
last year and their newest release, Die Berge, clocking in at just an
hour unlike &lt;a href="https://paysagedhiver.bandcamp.com/album/im-wald">Im Wald&lt;/a>, my previously favourite album of theirs which was
way longer, has been on repeat.&lt;/p>

&lt;/iframe>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve also been listening to Trhä a little along with other similar raw
black metal acts such as &lt;a href="https://lampofmurmuur.bandcamp.com">Lamp of Murmuur&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://ampwall.com/a/wolvendaughter">Wolven Daughter&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/iframe>

&lt;h2 id="what-i-ve-really-been-listening-to">What I&amp;rsquo;ve really been listening to&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What really has kept me going through this weird time is at the
intersection of sludge, hardcore, death metal and black metal. Here&amp;rsquo;s
a sample of what kind of music I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to over the last
week, for example. I would like to highlight a few albums and artists
from these, and others I listened to recently, over the course of this
article.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="revulsion-revulsion">Revulsion - Revulsion&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d recently made a more or less permanent switch to Bluesky from
Twitter and I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about and exchanging music with people
I&amp;rsquo;ve known from Twitter and new people I&amp;rsquo;ve met. Amongst the albums
that came up recently has been Revulsion&amp;rsquo;s self-titled album that was
released in February 2021. I picked this up from one of Westin&amp;rsquo;s posts
a few weeks back and I&amp;rsquo;ve been obsessed with the title track.&lt;/p>
&lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"
	src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=2559093933/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless>
&lt;/iframe>

&lt;p>The Finnish band, signed to Transcending Obscurity Records, plays a
style of death metal that is hard to put into any one sub-genre
label. It has elements of the old school Florida style but they refuse
to let that hold them back from blending a very strong groove with
double kick beats and slightly dissonant guitars.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="llnn-unmaker">LLNN - Unmaker&lt;/h3>
&lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"
 src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3718097988/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless>
&lt;/iframe>

&lt;p>Tim from Bluesky talks about *-core bands a lot but when he mentioned
the sludge band LLNN, which I&amp;rsquo;ve had on my list for a fairly long
time, I realised I should check it out. When I did post about it, he
replied asking if I could recommend any other similar sounding
music. I did suggest bands such as Gaza, Oldspeak, and others that
have been in regular rotation for me but it was only when Gary
Davidson entered the conversation that we found some very interesting
music. More about those in a bit but getting back to &lt;em>Unmaker&lt;/em>, it&amp;rsquo;s a
phenomenal record that blends elements of sludge with hardcore making
it crushingly heavy and oppressive. I&amp;rsquo;d recommend listening to this
when one is horrendously frustrated and needs something to help cope
with the exasperation that comes with it. This was released in
September 2021.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="coilguns-odd-love">Coilguns - Odd Love&lt;/h3>
&lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"
 src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=54361543/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless>
&lt;/iframe>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll be very honest that I have no clue what kind of music this is but
I just loved how the whole record had a kind of groove that makes you
want to just get up and dance. The tags show alternative noise, noise
rock, and something to do with punk and hardcore so maybe that might
make things clearer. It was another album that Tim mentioned a bunch
of times and so I just ended up listening to it. This was released in
November 2024.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="admiral-angry-buster">Admiral Angry - Buster&lt;/h3>
&lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"
 src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4071850960/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless>
&lt;/iframe>

&lt;p>One of Gary&amp;rsquo;s recommendations, this is a really loud and noise-ey
sludge record that blows your brains out. Throw it on if you liked
LLNN&amp;rsquo;s Unmaker and Primitive Man. The album is from June 2018.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="mico-zigurat">MICO - Zigurat&lt;/h3>
&lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"

&lt;p>I had realised that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t bought Cave Sermon&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://cavesermon.bandcamp.com/album/divine-laughter">latest&lt;/a> so when I
went to their Bandcamp page I saw that they&amp;rsquo;d recommended a few other
albums. MICO&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Zigurat&lt;/em> was one of them. What really drew me to this
project was how they&amp;rsquo;d infused sludge with grindcore seamlessly and
much like others that play this kind of metal (like Gaza) they&amp;rsquo;d
pulled it off spectacularly. I really don&amp;rsquo;t know much about them but
they&amp;rsquo;re definitely one of my best finds. The album was released in
June 2022.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are very few people that are into technical death metal that
haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of Alice Simard, a 20 year old Canadian
multi-instrumentalist who has one of the most impressive discographies
I&amp;rsquo;ve ever come across. Her &lt;a href="https://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Alice_Simard/813803">Metal Archives&lt;/a> page should tell you more
than enough about that. She typically plays a style of technical death
metal that has neoclassical elements amongst other styles but this is
a melodic death metal record with some of the most curious production
choices. Her death metal records usually have a very prominent bass in
the mix and in the case of this album, it elevates the sound to a very
nearly magical realm. This record was published on the first day
of 2025.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Released in June 2024, this is another phenomenal Alice Simard project
that Max Svalgard from the band &lt;a href="https://sublation.bandcamp.com">Sublation&lt;/a> introduced me to earlier
in 2023. The project has put out a few split LPs of which I had played
&lt;a href="https://filesharemaiden.bandcamp.com/album/uterokinesis">Uterokinesis&lt;/a>. Simard plays a kind of technical death metal with the
same prominent bass sound in the mix. She makes a wall of sound with
the guitars, drums and vocals on the one hand and that overlaid with
the bass sound makes for a very interesting listening experience. It&amp;rsquo;s
also interesting that Filesharemaiden has morphed from what used to be
a brutal death metal project into this.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Garry Brents has only put out the best nu-metal since I first got
acquainted with them in 2023, when I&amp;rsquo;d come across a post of theirs on
Twitter teasing Memorrhage&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://ampwall.com/a/memorrhage/album/memorrhage">self-titled debut&lt;/a> in a short video. His
music has since carved out a regular presence in my listening
habits. This EP is a teaser to a new phase of Gonemage, their black
metal and chiptune project (yeah, it sounds super fucking
interesting), in which they&amp;rsquo;ve moved to a more Emperor and
Dødheimsgard-esque sound. I am very excited to hear the full length
album that is to follow. The EP was released on the first Friday of
this year.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sallow Moth is Garry&amp;rsquo;s death metal project and this EP from October
2024 is again a prelude to a full-length that is to follow. It&amp;rsquo;s
brutal, it&amp;rsquo;s techy, and it&amp;rsquo;s got clean passages. If you enjoyed &lt;a href="https://ampwall.com/a/sallowmoth/album/stasis-cocoon">Stasis

&lt;p>RABM is something I got into fairly recently but this one man project
has been a part of my regular listening habits since it came out back
in September 2023. I&amp;rsquo;m unable to recall who really put me onto it but
I have the strongest feeling that this was something Violet from
&lt;a href="https://ampwall.com/a/wolvendaughter">Wolven Daughter&lt;/a> mentioned last year, which then reminded me about how
much I enjoyed this.&lt;/p>

&lt;/iframe>

&lt;p>I found this amongst some of the announcements for new albums on
Ampwall that their Bluesky profile posts occasionally and I just wound
up listening to it. They play a kind of progressive or technical black
metal that is actually not grating. The record came out in September 2024.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Violet from Wolven Daughter was talking about this album on Bluesky,
and about something in the water in Greece that makes some of the best
black metal in the world. I ended up playing it soon after. A kind of
black metal that is aggressive and deathy. It even feels like death
metal at some points. The album was released in June 2024&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, that&amp;rsquo;s all I&amp;rsquo;ve got for what I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to off-late. I
hope I end up making it a habit to write up pieces like this!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Notes from a withdrawal episode (part 0)</title><link>https://peregrinator.site/blog/2023/03/notes-from-a-withdrawal-episode-part-0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2023 00:12:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://peregrinator.site/blog/2023/03/notes-from-a-withdrawal-episode-part-0/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was starkly aware of how my last post, &lt;a href="https://peregrinator.site/blog/2023/03/notes-from-a-withdrawal-episode.html">Notes from a withdrawal
episode&lt;/a>, felt somewhat incomplete but couldn&amp;rsquo;t really figure out what
it was that was &amp;ldquo;missing&amp;rdquo; from it. Someone on twitter had asked
whether being on the medication was of any help and I responded to
this saying it was too large a topic to cover in tweets and that it
wasn&amp;rsquo;t something I could address on twitter — it would involve really
gathering my thoughts and writing a thread there while doing so
perhaps felt daunting at that point. It still took me a while to
figure out what was missing from my last post was something of a
description of what being on Methylphenidate was like and so I decided
to write this post about it as something of a &lt;em>prequel&lt;/em> to my last
post. Like I&amp;rsquo;d mentioned to the person that had asked that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t
as straightforward an answer as &lt;em>good&lt;/em> or &lt;em>bad&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My psychiatrist had initially started me off on a course of
Atomoxetine when I got the diagnosis and it felt like it helped
initially, because of the novelty of it, I imagine. Regardless, it
took me a while to understand that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working for me, perhaps
owing to the other drug I was on — Sertraline, a powerful SSRI
commonly known by its generic name Zoloft — which often left me
feeling groggy and exhausted all the time. It was when my doctor
started me off on Methylphenidate that I started seeing consistent
changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now this is a powerful stimulant and tricky to procure considering it
is an amphetamine. The relationship between ADHD and powerful
stimulants is interesting. People with ADHD typically have lower
levels of dopamine and vastly limited means to access it.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> Dopamine is the &amp;ldquo;reward&amp;rdquo; hormone and is automatically
released by the brain when one does activities they enjoy but this
release pathway isn&amp;rsquo;t as reliable or functional for someone with
ADHD.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> In order to artificially regulate dopamine
levels, stimulants such as amphetamines are used to hack the automatic
dopamine-high the drug provides as remedy for dysfunctional dopamine
signalling. My doctor got me started on Methylphenidate roughly 8
months back. Lower doses at first, slowly leading up to a steady 40 mg
(50 mg more recently).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initially, it felt a little exhilarating — possibly owing to the
novelty — but I was fairly certain of a difference in how motivated I
felt. Creative bursts, or hyperfocus sessions for that matter, were
more frequent when I&amp;rsquo;m unmedicated (and not in withdrawal) but they&amp;rsquo;re
also notoriously unreliable. They&amp;rsquo;re too random and unpredictable in
all senses of the word and any attempts at doing things consistency
ultimately fail because the kind of motivation is ultimately moody and
manic. Sometimes, a kind of restlessness overpowers my ability to do
anything meaningful and I&amp;rsquo;m left annoyed and irritable with my brain
on overdrive. The medication, in a sense, helps gather these
unmanageable peaks and troughs and even them out into a more steady
sort of motivation. Oddly enough, I still find that I&amp;rsquo;m more
&lt;em>involved&lt;/em> and capable of things that need more creative solutions in
some of my unmedicated hyperfocus sessions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m typically well aware of what tasks I&amp;rsquo;m yet to complete and despite
that I&amp;rsquo;m almost never able to get myself to do those things
unmedicated. I can maybe get one, relatively simple task done in the
same short-lived bursts of clarity described earlier but the moment
I&amp;rsquo;m done with it, an irritability and often a kind of anxiety sets in,
possibly stemming from fatigue. For perhaps the first 2-3 months on
the medication, I was able to do some of the larger tasks with ease
although I still needed breaks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could also notice, over the course of the entire period of time I
was on the medication, how I was significantly less preoccupied with
lowered self-esteem and getting carried away into dramatic depressive
states triggered by criticism or rejection (rejection sensitive
dysphoria)&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> — I even found that I was more
straightforward with dealing with conversations of the sort that
bothered me, especially those involving having my experiences
invalidated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I need to be constantly stimulated externally — a good coffee in the
morning that gets me going and more importantly keeps me alert. I&amp;rsquo;m
more dependent on this while I&amp;rsquo;m off the medication. Thinking back on
it, a large part of what I look for here is some degree of comfort —
as little sources of annoyance and a relatively peaceful space to do
things — to be able to work with any amount of consistency. While on
medication, these stop being needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The medication, however, has a few side effects that I&amp;rsquo;ve observed —
there are a lot more that one should look out for, some of these often
quite serious too.&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> The most prominent of these was
insomnia. I&amp;rsquo;ve had issues with sleep all along but this worsened for
the initial few months on the medication. The only solution that
showed promise in dealing with this was to plan and keep to a regular
routine. Melatonin could potentially help fall asleep but it made me
nauseous on the next day for several hours after waking. This, coupled with
intense withdrawal symptoms are perhaps the biggest issues I faced.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover everything, nor was it intended to. There are a few
things I have consciously omitted for the sake of my own
sanity. Regardless, I hope to make this and the other post into a
series I keep adding to periodically.&lt;/p>

Attention Span&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo; after they asked for new blog feeds they could follow
on the fediverse and I realised I wasn&amp;rsquo;t following their blog anywhere
— I&amp;rsquo;ve since added it everywhere, including in my openring
configuration — and got thinking about a thing or two about my own
progress with ADHD over the last four-odd years since my diagnosis. I
do see something of an arc in my capacity for regular work and keeping
at doing different kinds of work, similar to what they describe, but
I&amp;rsquo;m not nearly there yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find that there are some things I can stay focused on and work
through. Sadly these have minimal overlap with what I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen for my
career. I like working with computers — fooling around with R, trying
to learn e-lisp an figure out Emacs, and well, setting up this blog
too — and it&amp;rsquo;s startling to see how little there is in terms of job
opportunities that involve any of these within ecology or wildlife
science. I realise I&amp;rsquo;m digressing but the point I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make
here is that I find that my attention span having improved applies
only to a very limited kind of thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been roughly two weeks since I ran out of my medication
(Methylphenidate — commonly known as Ritalin or Concerta) and I&amp;rsquo;ve
been experiencing some withdrawal symptoms. This is the longest I&amp;rsquo;ve
been off this since I got started some six months back. I&amp;rsquo;ve had
disturbed sleep (I&amp;rsquo;m writing this at midnight!), heightened anxiety
that often manifests as anxiety attacks, and in general rapid mood
changes and more but I&amp;rsquo;ve also seen some things that were surprising.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The same kinds of work I thought I could do better has become a whole
lot easier to do now, while I&amp;rsquo;m in this withdrawal state, for the most
part. I also find my thoughts to be clearer and that I no longer miss
out on important cues of various kinds. This is quite irregular but is
in no way sustainable in the long term for myriad reasons.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Moved to Sourcehut!</title><link>https://peregrinator.site/blog/2023/03/moved-to-sourcehut/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2023 03:51:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://peregrinator.site/blog/2023/03/moved-to-sourcehut/</guid><description>&lt;p>I wrote to Drew DeVault a couple of days back, after much deliberation
on whether I should really bother him and the like, about free access
to Sourcehut builds so I could move away from Github and Gitlab. He
responded soon after that saying that he&amp;rsquo;d given me a year&amp;rsquo;s
access. And I&amp;rsquo;ve finally done it! The blog that started off titled
&lt;em>peregrinator&amp;rsquo;s sourcehut site&lt;/em> along with an explanation on why it was
called that while hosted on Github-pages is finally here! The next
step would be to move to a personal or custom domain of my own, but
that&amp;rsquo;s a long way into the future, yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, this brings me closer to what I&amp;rsquo;ve got planned for my
internet presence — minimal and without JavaScript. Although I&amp;rsquo;m
pleased with how this has &lt;em>simplified&lt;/em> a lot of things, this also means
a few new things to keep in mind for me and this is perhaps of most
interest here.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="git">Git&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been honing my command-line git skills over the last few years
but since repository settings are threadbare on Sourcehut, I&amp;rsquo;ll have
to really step up my game here. I&amp;rsquo;ve already faced some minor setbacks
to my work, on this blog incidentally. I&amp;rsquo;d &lt;em>gitignored&lt;/em> the folder with
the Org-mode sources for all of my blog posts and other pages and then
checked out an older version of my blog posts source from the last
commit with the file. Since this was from prior to adding &lt;code>gitignore&lt;/code>
functionality, it was at-least an entry older with a bunch of crucial
changes I&amp;rsquo;d made yesterday. I had to manually recover this eventually.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maintaining multiple branches, juggling remotes - since this shares
its files with those from my older Github-pages site — all was a bit
overwhelming initially but I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to clean up most of the cruft
and I&amp;rsquo;m starting to get more confident around git.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="content-restrictions">Content restrictions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The biggest &amp;ldquo;hit&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve taken is the restrictions on third-party
content - see &lt;a href="https://peregrinator.site/blog/2023/02/albums-of-the-year-2022.html">Albums of the Year&lt;/a>, my last post for example. The
Sourcehut site documentation states that they disallow external
style-sheets, especially those accessed via CDNs but crucially
third-party embedded content.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t mean
much to most - especially if the content of blog posts is text and
some code - but since some of my posts are about music, I find that
this restriction gets in my way. I cannot add embedded albums or
tracks Bandcamp. Bandcamp is what I prefer when it comes to music
since they&amp;rsquo;re the most artist-friendly amongst streaming
platforms.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve since changed my Bandcamp shortcode from a minimal, single
positional argument based kind to one that uses an additional URL
rendered as a simple link below the &lt;code>iframe&lt;/code>. Of course, with Sourcehut
pages, the &lt;code>iframe&lt;/code> is just a blank rectangle of the same dimensions as
the embedded Bandcamp content.&lt;/p>

things was never something I enjoyed and since I have a tendency to
forget artists and albums, often even those that I listen to
regularly. I also remember bands by sound and almost inevitably refuse
to keep track of when artists I like release new music. This is in no
sense complete nor could I get myself to write about each of the
albums — I’ll perhaps get down to this sometime later. There is no
ranking within this list for the same reasons as before&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ken-mode-null">KEN mode - Null&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Exasperated with everything good in life going to dogs? Throw Your
Phone in the River! It’s noisy, ambient with an abundance of harsh
industrial sounds blended into the background, delivered with bleak,
sludgy instrumentation. This time they’re a four piece, with the
addition of Kathryn Kerr bringing in the saxophone and it expectedly
sounds great with this brand of metal. This release also marks a
stylistic shift from their typically outright angry sound to this
tinge of despair in the way the vocals are delivered.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="primitive-man-insurmountable">Primitive Man - Insurmountable&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>From practitioners of the most brutal form of Death/Sludge arguably
pioneered by them, the latest offering from Primitive Man bludgeons
the anxieties and dread that came with the pandemic into a
slow-burning, gloomy and angry 4 track record. Their sound appears to
have been perfected over the years into the combination of oppressive
mammoth-like riffs, a loud menacing bass, copious amounts of guitar
feedback and noise samples embedded into the background, and drums
with the hint of a twang on the snare leaving the listener in an
atmosphere dripping with tension and apprehension. McCarthy’s vocals
are as wild as ever — there’s undertones of the sludge scream, the
black metal snarl, alloyed with the Death-growl into guttural lows and
highs. This album also includes a cover of “Quiet” by the Smashing
Pumpkins.&lt;/p>
&lt;iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"

&lt;/iframe>

&lt;p>Ethan McCarthy’s other project — Vermin Womb — also saw a new release
that I’d also recommend. It’s similar sounding in the instrumentation
and overall feel but has songs with a more blackened and chaotic

&lt;h2 id="kathryn-mohr-holly">Kathryn Mohr - Holly&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Liminal perhaps describes the kind of music Kathryn Mohr makes
accurately and in a single word but it’s got a lot more to it. I find
that listening to this album when I need to unwind makes the process a
lot easier and a great deal more enjoyable, but I’m inevitably left
craving more. Holly has droney chords strummed on a Jazzmaster (?),
fuzzy and exclusively on neck pickups — and I feel like I shouldn’t
have to describe this any further but I’ll just add that it takes the
edge off the typical bright tone. This perfectly compliments haunting,
layered vocals that sometimes sound off-key. The vocals don’t appear
to be too central to her sound and songs are often instrumental,
overlaid with pretty synth riffs and crucially set in a brown-noise
base. Also worth noting is the way tracks are arranged in the style of
a cassette release — both sides have short instrumental introductory
pieces and is available as a cassette on her Bandcamp!&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="chat-pile-god-s-country">Chat Pile - God&amp;rsquo;s Country&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What hasn’t been said about the Purple man that took the world by
storm with their debut album, under the Flenser label, no less. Heavy
guitars and skull numbing reverb laden drums thumping out slow and
dark songs about despair and the anti-anthem “Why”. Needless to say,
I’m sold on the Purple Man.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="miscreance-convergence">Miscreance - Convergence&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I came across them when the Dead Neanderthals tweeted&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not enough people are talking about this album. &lt;br>&lt;br>A perfect mix of Death (Human era), Pestilence (Consvming era) and Revenant!&lt;a href="https://t.co/LrJFPwEnBJ">https://t.co/LrJFPwEnBJ&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Dead Neanderthals (also on bsky.app) (@deadneanderthal) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/deadneanderthal/status/1620492647025758210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 31, 2023&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>


&lt;p>and I’m in full agreement. Being the dedicated Death fan (for life),
this does indeed sound like Chuck Schuldiner performed the
vocals. Both Pestilence and Death drips off their thrashy, bass-heavy
minor key riffs.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="mamaleek-diner-coffee">Mamaleek - Diner Coffee (?)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As the Flenser repeatedly tweets, Who is Mamaleek?. Weird noisey and
dark but it’s really hard to describe them without sounding insane.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I came to realise they had a new release out when I saw and absurd
“meme” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX4GOltUDdA">video&lt;/a> on Youtube. It’s got the usual sick groove but I could
have sworn a pronounced blackening to their riffs.&lt;/p>

 &lt;/div>

&lt;h2 id="wormrot-hiss">Wormrot - Hiss&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It’s got everything a Wormrot album promises in grindcore, but this
release felt more mellow as compared to the brutally fast and precise
riffing/drums from earlier releases.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="exhumed-to-the-dead">Exhumed - To The Dead&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Morbidly groovy and detuned Death/Grind, often reminiscent of
Carcass’s very old grindcore delivers human entrails yet again. 2022
has been a prolonged fangirling moment for Doktor Ross Sewage and
every band he’s played with. His twitter feed is never boring.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="wake-thought-form-descent">Wake - Thought Form Descent&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There’s no words I can conjure to describe Wake humanly. It’s got
everything — sickeningly catchy riffs like grindcore, dark ambient
black metal and post-metal — but then there’s so much more. It’s loud
and hits you like a tidal wave but is also meditative of sorts.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="hath-all-that-was-promised">Hath - All That Was Promised&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Modern Death metal that is blackened and sometimes slightly
technical. There are mellow passages too but ultimately the album
feels not as abstract as older Death metal and betrays a sort of
sorrow.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="thou-and-mizmor-myopia">Thou &amp;amp; Mizmor - Myopia&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Trepidation and tension does make one myopic. Doom with a good deal of

</description></item><item><title>Blog revamp and starting to understand Hugo better</title><link>https://peregrinator.site/blog/2023/02/blog-revamp-and-starting-to-understand-hugo-better/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2023 16:24:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://peregrinator.site/blog/2023/02/blog-revamp-and-starting-to-understand-hugo-better/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d decided to make the switch to a blogging workflow that I could use
with Emacs back in December and &lt;a href="https://peregrinator.site/blog/2022/12/hugo-org-and-starting-over-at-a-new-blog.html">wrote about&lt;/a> setting it up from
scratch. Since I wasn&amp;rsquo;t yet acquainted with writing original layout
templates, style-sheets or with organising content into sections in as
simple and sane a manner as I wanted to, I&amp;rsquo;d settled for outsourcing
most of this to a fairly &lt;a href="https:/github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch">basic theme&lt;/a>. Over time, I grew dissatisfied
with how the site looked and how it organised my content and so I
spent some time customising the theme, which took a while to figure
out. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy with it still. I then tried changing themes a few
times but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything that really worked for me. That I
didn&amp;rsquo;t want any JavaScript I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand, or could understand
for that matter, effectively eliminated a lot of the options I had
considered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It then dawned on me that I could maybe attempt writing a theme for
myself from (nearly) scratch when I found two themes that seemed to
check out most of my requirements. The first of these was &lt;a href="https://github.com/mavidser/hugo-rocinante/">rocinante&lt;/a> by
&lt;a href="https://github.com/mavidser">Sid Verma&lt;/a>, a great and adequately minimal theme with added support for
photo albums as posts. My only qualms with it were the somewhat messy
style sheets and cryptic templates that made personalising a bit of an
ordeal. The second, however, was simply genius and it took me close to
no time to figure it out, despite thinking it to be too advanced for
me — there was no theme sub-module and everything was in the home
directory it was from somebody&amp;rsquo;s personal website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Needless to say, it was Drew DeVault&amp;rsquo;s and I&amp;rsquo;d seen it as something of
an inspiration from the start. A quick glance at &lt;a href="https://drewdevault.com">Drew Devault&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a>
should convey what I mean by minimal and functional. I jumped right
into a local clone of his &lt;a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/drewdevault.com">sourcehut repo&lt;/a> and got down to making it my
own. I added some minor spice to the `single.html` layout under `blog`
and made an additional few for&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>posts from my Wordpress blog I didn&amp;rsquo;t want listed on the homepage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a section index that listed the above&lt;/li>
&lt;li>fiction (just the one post)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>an &lt;em>About me&lt;/em> page (not a section, unlike before)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the browser friendly copy of my &lt;a href="https://peregrinator.site/emacs/literate_emacs_configuration.html">Literate Emacs Configuration&lt;/a> with
a table of contents in the sidebar and heading anchors.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I realised I didn&amp;rsquo;t want unnecessary taxonomy pages like before or
like those from the rocinante theme and that all my regular blog
posts, Emacs configuration and fiction on the homepage. The prospect
of having to write descriptions for each of these — had I maintained
separate sections for each like before — was daunting, to say the
least.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also loved the idea of displaying &amp;ldquo;featured posts&amp;rdquo; from the blogs I
follow through Drew&amp;rsquo;s own &lt;a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/openring">openring&lt;/a>, written in Go. The only issue I
encountered was with adding this to the Github actions workflows since
it&amp;rsquo;s not as straightforward as the one Sourcehut uses and the absurdly
large number of modules is mind-boggling. Until I find a way of
getting this automated, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to keep at running the command
manually every few days before committing/pushing changes.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>There were also some issues with date handling in the ox-hugo setup
and I ended up rewriting the org-capture template to allow for entries
into both the main blog section and the miscellaneous one. The capture
template now looks like this:&lt;/p>

discussing a bunch of tangential points like design choices and the
&amp;ldquo;criteria&amp;rdquo; for making this the best starting point for my blog. I&amp;rsquo;ll
perhaps cover those in later articles.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Having to use Windows, reluctantly</title><link>https://peregrinator.site/blog/2022/12/having-to-use-windows-reluctantly/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peregrinator.site/blog/2022/12/having-to-use-windows-reluctantly/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since my laptop is an ancient clay tablet that can barely run Emacs
and a couple of other things without everything crashing, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to
use a lab workstation with about 128 GB RAM and a fairly new Intel
processor for running some of my analyses. It&amp;rsquo;s phenomenally fast for
a computer that runs Windows and gets most things done easily. It&amp;rsquo;s
only when I run something that&amp;rsquo;s something memory intensive when
things really start to get muddled up. I could just be incredibly bad
at R programming but boy, it hit 105 GB of the RAM and slowed the hell
down. It&amp;rsquo;s been like this since last night and now there&amp;rsquo;s nothing I
can do but wait. Surely a Linux or FreeBSD system would have had lower
core functioning thresholds for all of this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another fairly weird detail was that it was set to use a UK keyboard
layout unlike almost any PC that&amp;rsquo;s made in these parts. It was so easy
to change but almost no-one had it figured until I got here.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hugo, Org and starting over at a new blog</title><link>https://peregrinator.site/blog/2022/12/hugo-org-and-starting-over-at-a-new-blog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://peregrinator.site/blog/2022/12/hugo-org-and-starting-over-at-a-new-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d decided to give up on my free WordPress blog a while back, after
having watched a SystemCrafters &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/AfkrzFodoNw">video&lt;/a> on how to blog from Emacs (&lt;em>d&amp;rsquo;oh&lt;/em>,
I just &lt;em>have&lt;/em> to do everything from Emacs). Of course, daviwil only
covered the basics of writing and exporting using Emacs&amp;rsquo; built-in
packages and later for deploying it on GitHub / Sourcehut pages. And
it took me a good year to get down to making the switch but apparently
moving to a new place for work is the motivation it required. It felt
like cheating to use Jekyll on GitHub and I wanted something that
could be deployed to a Sourcehut site easily too (Sourcehut blocks any
CDN-based CSS loaded into the site&amp;rsquo;s HTML) and I wanted something
extremely minimal, like Drew Devault&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://drewdevault.com/">blog&lt;/a> but with even fewer
frills — no images anywhere except for if a blog post required
them. Looking at his blog source, however, made me realise that there
was a lot more to that minimalism than one could see.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="basic-setup">Basic setup&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This has come through fairly well, so far. I&amp;rsquo;ve got an &lt;a href="https://peregrinator.site/emacs/emacs-literate-configuration/#ox-hugo-since-the-go-org-keep-wrecking-up-links">org-capture
setup&lt;/a> for this that links up every new entry captured into a master
posts file, adding all the relevant info.&lt;/p>

yet), tags and organisation of pages into bundles is handled by
ox-hugo &lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;sup>, &lt;/sup>&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. The
header arguments in the capture template cover everything. With
Emacs&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>.dir-locals.el&lt;/code> feature, a file of that name in the home
directory of the blog ensures every new entry or modification into the
master posts file gets auto-exported to markdown on save. The contents
are quite simple.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>With Emacs&amp;rsquo;s Org mode, this posts file has subheadings under a
&lt;em>Posts&lt;/em> header, each of which is a blog post and is exported to a

got going feels a little hacky but I&amp;rsquo;ll figure this out.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automatic-deployment">Automatic deployment&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Hugo, being a static site generator, creates HTML exports into
&lt;code>~/public&lt;/code> and this is what the site uses. All major git hosting
services have configurable CI/CD for deploying these to the domain and
they&amp;rsquo;re run automatically if you have a specific file in either&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>the root directory of the repo for Sourcehut called &lt;code>.build.yml&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>~/.github/workflows/&lt;/code> for GitHub called anything you want with a
&lt;code>.yml&lt;/code> extension.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

It possibly arose from the need
to manage larger groups of people that congregated near agricultural
fields as Jared Diamond suggests in Guns, Germs and Steel&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> although it may
have originated in tribal or hunter-gatherer societies. It is strongly
linked with religion which can viewed as a cement holding together
larger population masses. Recent developments in its research suggests
two perspectives of culture: an outcome of natural selection which
considers humans part of “nature” and culture as a purely human
construct which arose as a consequence of advanced emotional
intelligence which natural selection (according to believers of this
theory) cannot explain. In order to see the effects on natural
selection, one has to take a neutral stance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is established that natural selection cannot be evaded&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> and as an
outcome of this culture can be viewed as a consequence of
natural selection. In other words, culture, in the context
of human evolution, was selected for since it subsidised
the struggle for life for the group. Individuals have to
forego some individual “rights” in order to support the
group as a whole. These “rights” include privacy, a certain
amount of aggression towards others in the groups – things
such a revenge – and so on. This is in essence altruistic
which is inherently a group selected trait. The development
of fire, agriculture, medicine and later various
technologies have indeed helped the human race jump forward
in the evolutionary struggle. This is, however, at the
level of the group (group here refers to human society).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One inevitably comes across workers who suggest that culture has
influenced the natural of man and has in a certain sense of the word
excluded humans from natural selection. This is possibly true at the
level of the individual as a cripple would not be able to survive in
the wild as opposed to a healthy individual. Similarly, individuals of
advanced age now have higher life expectancy in contrast to those of
animals or even pre-society humans since parents are taken care of by
offspring. Various other societal precepts have affected how
individuals are selected for today. But since group selection offers a
better means to justify the situation today, it must be viewed in that
perspective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now the question arises that evolution produces only advanced species
that are best adapted to survive in the world and that since humans
have the added ability to “think” and “analyse” the consequences of
this “advance” might not be sustainable. This may be true albeit since
evolution is merely the accumulation of adaptions, any form of
foresight (that is required in the intelligent design of humans) in
the adaptations of species that have been brought to existence by
evolutionary mechanisms. Sustainability is merely a human construct
whose proponent is culture. This hence further reinforces the
hypothesis that culture and all of its corollaries are a consequence
of natural selection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It can thus be concluded that cultural evolution has only affected
individual survival while at the group level, it is but a consequence
of natural selection.&lt;/p>

destruction to native wildlife, but since very little research has
been done in that field, things remain unclear. Most of the cases
where the extreme case of extinction occurred were on islands, but
this does not indicate that the mainland is safe from this. A lack of
visible evidence, either scientific or not, &lt;em>does not&lt;/em> indicate
that such animals are not killing wildlife regularly, or that the
consequences of having them around are negligible. There are several
signs that some areas may be more vulnerable to the effects of
invasive animals than others.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For those of you that haven&amp;rsquo;t read my &lt;a href="https://peregrinator.site/blog/2016/01/a-dark-side-to-pets/">earlier article&lt;/a> on the issues
with keeping free ranging pets and having stray carnivores, I would
recommend going through it first although it is not an absolute
necessity to understand the concepts explained here. Also, some
evolutionary concepts are dealt with so for a better understand
consider going through my articles on evolution as well. Note that
this is a clarification to those who are not convinced of the issues
brought to light in the older article. I will also explain the issues
associated with the introduction of non-carnivorous pets in a
&lt;em>previously undisturbed&lt;/em> environment. The driving factor behind
my writing this article was conversations with people not familiar
with the scientific way of thought that made me realise that unless
the complete issues are spelled out, the ideas will not be
understood. Additionally, another snake was nearly killed recently by
an adopted feral cat (refer to my older article for the details of the
snake killed). It must also be noted here that pets not only include
cats and dogs but also livestock such a cows, goats, sheep and
buffaloes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The consequences of the introduction of animals into an area
previously unexposed to it can be very subtle for the lay mind to
comprehend since the interactions between humans and the environment
are virtually ignored. Inter-connectedness is the quintessence of
ecology without which none of its theories can be justified. Similar
are the consequences of introducing alien plant species (alien here
refers to those species from often from other continents, but not
necessarily always so) or with disease. &lt;em>Lantana camara&lt;/em> was
introduced in India a couple of hundred years earlier and today it has
replaced the understory in most of the peninsular dry deciduous
forests and occupied a great portion of the arid scrub jungles. It,
however, cannot be easily removed (as is with the case of free ranging
pets and strays) as now several other animals and plants have
developed certain crucial interactions with &lt;em>Lantana&lt;/em>. Removal
of &lt;em>Lantana&lt;/em> has been largely unsuccessful for various reasons,
which is atleast in this case advantageous but it may not be the case
always.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I wish to make clear through the course of this essay is that
human intervention in the functioning of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s environment can
no longer be ignored since human presence has grown disproportionately
in the last few thousand years. This means that the repercussions of
even growing food for even a tenth of the current population are so
great that it could drive several species of native wildlife extinct.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="isolation-in-its-various-forms">Isolation in its various forms&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What in essence happens when a ecosystem, previously unexposed to a
certain kind of animal or plant, is suddenly introduced with an alien
species? Tribal communities living in isolation were exposed to
disease such as common cold and other such diseases by visiting people
from modern society which spread rapidly (examples of which are seen
in the Jarawas and explained in Jared Diamond&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Guns, Germs and
Steel&lt;/em>). But note that this is a closed environment. Such tribals
typically live outside cities with limited interaction to the outside
world. The consequences of the introduction of an alien species is
typically the same in several cases. Unprepared and susceptible, at
the mercy of the new species, most are affected, usually
adversely. This must is to be kept in mind albeit it should also be
adverted to the fact that this doesn&amp;rsquo;t occur in all cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In talking about carnivorous pets in my last article, I got too
carried away by them and failed to touch on the consequences of
herbivorous “pets” on undisturbed ecosystems, as was pointed out in
one of the comments. What should one expect with free ranging
herbivores such as cows and other livestock in such a scenario?
Numbers of individuals introduced here are insignificant since the
“lethal dose” of number of these animals will in any case be attained
over a short period of time. Herds of goats and cows feed over large
tracts of grass covered areas which is usually unable to regenerate
due to their continuous onslaught. The effects are naturally amplified
(given the additional absence of carnivores) in the case of smaller
herbivores such as rabbits and hares which breed rapidly and clear
large stretches of grassland. Uncontrolled grazing results in the
denudation of natural forest in its various forms and hence native
herbivores are the first hit. Since the native fauna and flora
maintained an equilibrium between plant consumption and animal
population, this is now disrupted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So when do the effects of introduced species get felt? I have already
suggested that extinctions due to introduced species has a high
prevalence in the case of islands. What about islands is so peculiar?
I will return to these questions a little later in the essay. A stable
ecosystem is one where the population of each species is regulated or
maintained in spite of predation, herbivory and other such
interactions. That is to say that if a certain number of (for example)
a bird species are killed each year, that species continues to survive
because over time new individuals replace those lost. The predators
continually switch over to alternate food sources and hence the
pressure on the prey reduces (from the constant high pressure offered
by specialist predators, which are typically rare in the wild). This
is usually seen if the ecosystem is spread over a large area with a
sufficiently large population of prey that is distributed through the
area, allowing movement of populations across the area. If the
predator species kill too many individuals of that bird species, the
predators will have nothing to feed on and hence will die out with the
bird population, but this extreme is quite rare. This is usually
avoided and such an equilibrium is in all cases maintained by varying
numbers of predator and prey. The same is the case with plant species
and herbivores. Such plasticity exists in all ecosystems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Islands are continually changing in their species composition. Rather
than having an equilibrium between populations of species, there is a
balance between extinctions (or to be more precise extirpations) and
immigrations. A limited availability of resources allows only a small
number of individuals to reside on it (excesses are not trimmed off
and eventually drive the species extinct). The number of species also
is considerably lower than on the corresponding mainland. Combined,
the two mentioned factors allow a very low number of species,
represented by a very small population inhabiting the island. Hence,
local extinctions are frequent and seemingly causeless, although minor
changes of any aspect are the cause. The same is the case with
fragmented forests and “islands” on the mainland. Once extinction
occurs, there is a greater likelihood of “immigrating” species to
establish themselves. This fragile state of island biodiversity
prevents the continuity of life once an invasive species is introduced
since minor changes can disrupt the species composition. In addition,
islands are more likely to have species that although might have
evolved from those of the mainland, are considerably different and
hence endemic. The extirpation (or extinction) of a species implies
that the species that comes in its place could be altogether
different, hence endemics and in most cases even other species lost on
an island are lost forever. Island fauna is also tame since exposures
to predators are typically lacking due to the absence of such a
selection pressure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Isolation also can be created by the construction of man-made
barriers, especially in the case of plants and herpetofauna and other
fauna with limited mobility. Roads, canals and other such structures
limits further their mobility. Other more subtle selective pressures
applied could also play a role in this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some form of isolation that is seen in cases where species have been
introduced, plays an important role. Islands are isolated since they
are less easily accessible to reptiles, amphibians and most plants
from almost anywhere else. Plants, as already suggested cannot bear
the brunt of the advance of herbivores unlike animals which tend to,
over time, develop behavioural adaptations. There are however more
complex forms of isolation, even on the mainland, explained below.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="consequences-of-invasion">Consequences of invasion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Island fauna, as mentioned above, is tame and hence introduced
predators (such as cats and dogs) can approach them without having to
expend energy in stalking and other forms of subtlety. In the case of
flora, islands are as susceptible to denudation as the mainland as
plants (unlike animals) are not as dynamic and cannot survive the
onslaught of a rapidly growing population of herbivores. Forest
fragmentation ensues in part due to overgrazing by livestock and the
removal of forest cover to meet food requirements with agriculture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result of forest fragmentation, an original population of a
species specific to that forest type, becomes isolated in these
pockets. In most cases, likely including that of birds, the
individuals from each region cannot or do not migrate to others due to
territorial boundaries. The consequence is small unstable populations
of species that are extremely susceptible to &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/extirpate">extirpation&lt;/a> for a variety
of reasons. Inbreeding causes loss of genetic diversity and
consequently deleterious mutations accumulate causing lower likelihood
of survival; loss of genetic variation also increases the risk of
extirpation by &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/zoonosis">zoonotic&lt;/a> disease, which has been shown to have a
greater prevalence in the fauna inhabiting fragmented forests even
otherwise, such as in the case of Lion-tailed Macaques (&lt;em>Macaca
silenus&lt;/em>) and Civets in the Western Ghats (and additionally other
mammal species); and predation itself can very likely wipe out the
small population, the risks of which are greatly increased by
introduced (typically animal) species which are either better adapted
to hunting, or through competition for limited food resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cows and other livestock are generally kept in large groups such that
the yield of milk will be sufficient to not only satisfy individual
and family needs but for its use as a commercialized source of
livelihood. The cattle has to be provided not just dry feed but need
fresh fodder for which a good source is grass in scrub jungles and
meadows, and several shrubs in the same and other types of
forest. These are readily used. As sensible as this may sound, large
numbers of cattle are detrimental to the forest ecosystem. Selective
feeding on plants, that is subsidised from predation by human
intervention can result in the formation of an imbalanced ecosystem:
native herbivores lose out on vital food resources and hence drop in
numbers as a result of which predators are affected. This leads to a
more permanent loss of forest cover in part since less faeces in the
soil implies less fertility and hence native plant species don&amp;rsquo;t
survive and disperse. The paucity of plants adversely affects bees,
other pollinators on which birds and some animals feed, and affects
native herbivore populations which again impacts the predators. This
cycle repeats itself several times to leave either small fragments of
forest or none at all and as a result not one but several species of
biota is impacted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Disease of animals, known as zoonotic disease, are on the rise as a
result of close interaction of wildlife and humans. Diseases of urban
and man-made origin are now prevalent in several feral and domestic
animals. With the high incidence of these animals entering native
forests, these diseases very likely will be transmitted to wildlife
and being unequipped to deal with such, a large number of individuals
will be lost. Additionally, forest fragmentation by human activities
reduces wildlife to even smaller groups of individuals that face a
greater likelihood of contracting zoonotic diseases from nearby human
settlements. Smaller populations that have limited interaction with
each other are more susceptible to disease. Diseases of livestock such
as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinderpest">rinderpest&lt;/a> are known to affect not only wild bovine species but
reportedly affect cervines (i.e. Deer) and other related wildlife.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Species, selectively impacted by disease or predation, can cause
additionally complications. Disease of carnivores resulting in their
extermination causes a boom in herbivore populations which as a result
of overgrazing leads to loss of habitat. A cascade of extinctions are
likely to follow: this loss of food sources for herbivores can be
detrimental to other herbivores which would have to resort to
migration to survive and would otherwise perish. Any predatorial
species dependent on these animals would also suffer. A similar result
can occur by the loss of herbivores to disease or predation: with less
fertile faeces, lowered fertility reduces the dispersal of trees or
selectively propagates certain species which may or may not be
beneficial to the ecosystem; the predators due to a lack of prey die
out.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="solutions">Solutions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Possible ways feral animals can be controlled are few: culling and
sterilisation are possibly the most effective and easily implemented,
although these are quite inhumane. Rescue agencies in cities catch and
tend to such animals and usually give the animals out as pets
later. This could be a more sensible and humane method although
excesses have to be dealt with rapidly. Sterilization might be in the
longer run more effective. Keeping domestic and adopted cats indoors
at all times is the possibly the only way their killing of wildlife
can be prevented. Dealing with cattle in India is further complicated
by the fact that cows are considered sacred. I shall not advocate any
measure to deal with cattle for this reason (although probably I will
write about this issue later).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It now is apparent that these issues have to be better studied and
areas that face greater risks have to be identified. Measures taken
will have to be specific to those areas and have to be implemented
rapidly without fail.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sustainability and the Common Man</title><link>https://peregrinator.site/blog/2017/03/sustainability-and-the-common-man/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2017 10:43:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://peregrinator.site/blog/2017/03/sustainability-and-the-common-man/</guid><description>&lt;p>Policy with respect to sustainability in India has never been top
priority, until very recently. It has often been fraught with people&amp;rsquo;s
predispositions that should never have come about in the first
place. I will be talking about the ways of a singe man I know, let&amp;rsquo;s
call him Devdas (original name withheld for various reasons) and how
almost all of his actions were made knowing about the state of
wildlife in India.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my 21 years, one word that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard consistently in discussions
of any sort is &lt;em>sustainability&lt;/em>. Due to its overuse, particularly very
frivolously, I must say over the years the word has lost its meaning
but the concepts have somehow become clearer (as a result of my own
digging and research). Being from a school with a rich biodiversity in
its very own campus, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a very heartening thing to hear. What
I don&amp;rsquo;t understand, however, is the fact that actually very few people
that I&amp;rsquo;ve interacted with in my latter 18 years get involved in either
the conservation of wildlife or the policy making it closely
associates with. This becomes clearer when one understands the latent
intrinsic characters of the people that run the school, albeit that is
a topic for an essay by itself. As I will write in most of my upcoming
papers, the fauna and flora of the Eastern Ghats has not received much
attention and the cause and outcome of this is seen in the people that
inhabit the region.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="beginnings">Beginnings&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The person whom I will be talking about is from a rural region of the
Eastern Ghats, probably on the coast. His upbringing was in the medium
of the language spoken in that place and definitely excluded the hot
topics of biodiversity, conservation, and sustainability. Most of his
childhood was spent trying to find means of indulging in fun and
frolic without being discovered by (possibly) strict parents. The
parents would also have been quite unaware of such issues as they
would have been labouring to make ends meet. This person, like all
others in his village, wanted to come up in life and so he took up the
course of education that was necessary for the challenging exams one
was required to clear for a career in Chartered Accountancy. Usually a
well paid discipline, he had to settle for a not-so-high salary post
in a remote school. That was where I met him. It might have been some
nine or ten years ago that Devdas first came to work in this
school. Since I was studying in that school, and during vacations
everyone staying back met frequently (not to mention knowing each
other fairly well) we saw each other very often. Devdas was a young
chap, maybe in his twenties then, fairly naïve (as was I: naïve, not
in my twenties!) and with a keen inferiority complex. His English was
not the best as a result of which he would interact only with a select
group of individuals, mainly those he though were “in his league”. He
was jovial in the sense that he wanted to lighten the generally
hostile environment that he lived in to make his time alone pass along
faster. Initially I talked to him a lot, and every time I went to his
spartan apartment, there would be eggs lying around in the kitchen and
a pile of old accountancy textbooks in a corner gathering dust. I
never knew how he passed his time because soon after I got a new
friends circle and he was not in it. I did still say the occasional
hello and what&amp;rsquo;s up, but that was all.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Now I don&amp;rsquo;t know what his life was like in truth in the few years that
I didn&amp;rsquo;t meet him or talk to him. All I heard after this period, which
lasted nearly 8 or nine years, was rumours and more rumours, all of
which is completely irrelevant here. A change that I had seen was that
he had bought his own new motorbike and used it to travel even to the
place he worked that was barely 200 meters away from where he now
stayed. He had made several new friends and some that lived elsewhere
even stayed with him when they visited. However, certain other aspects
of his character, I could never understand, whether they were new
because I had not gotten to know him earlier. It is those that I will
be talking about here.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="an-ode-to-plastics-the-wonderful">An ode to plastics, the wonderful!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If asked to lecture on the science behind plastics, both Devdas and
Donald Trump would very likely say the very same things. On a trip to
the nearby village, as usual on his motorbike, we purchased a large
bag of &lt;em>pakodas&lt;/em> diligently wrapped in old newspaper, tied with
synthetic string and finally placed inside a black plastic bag. To
wash hands we got some plastic packets of water, a cheaper alternative
to buying the unnecessary plastic bottle (we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend that
much money). Of course, I enjoyed eating this fast food, excessively
oily, salty and essentially the bane to human existence, as did
he. Now in his thirties, he continues to eat this junk and has the
nerve to talk about maintaining health! (That, I will write about
another time just for the sheer hilariousness.) Well, we found an
isolated sheet rock that was easy to access, as the numerous broken
bottles of alcoholics indicated, we ate and finally when the time came
to dispose of (what I knew to be non-biodegradable) plastics and
paper, he did the most predictable thing. He got up and walked to his
motor bike. Of course, after tossing aside, with almost a certain
flair, the oily newspaper, the plastics and bits of leftovers. I
looked at him inquisitively and, finally realising subtlety was not
his forte, asked him why he had left the plastic there. He merely
waved me off and we left. I was not satisfied. This happened again
soon after, and again, and again and again. Put simply this was what
would happen every time he went out. So eventually I confronted him
one day. His explanation was probably the most well thought out and,
as you shall see why, transformed the way I think entirely. I mean,
the way I think about him. Of course not the way I think about
plastics!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Biggibee&lt;/em> [thats what he calls me, a corruption of Big-B], why you
worry? This plastic and all will go in 2 or three years! Go to that
place where they dump plastics. It will not be there in some years.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I say that it&amp;rsquo;s because people collect it and dump it elsewhere and
that plastic is not biodegradable.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>No &lt;em>yaar&lt;/em>! Not like that! I have seen! Plastic will go!&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I remind him that cows and other animals including wildlife eat that
and die. After two minutes silence:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>No &lt;em>yaar&lt;/em>. Nothing like that.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well, I kept quiet since I realised how futile it might be to have an
argument about something he was so convinced about.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Half a year down the line, we still go out to eat, sit in the same
places and do the same things. I ask him about it once in a while but
don&amp;rsquo;t press for a definite answer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="if-you-re-not-a-drinker-you-still-can-have-fun-with-bottles">If you&amp;rsquo;re not a drinker, you still can have fun with bottles&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Even if we aren&amp;rsquo;t eating anything he sometimes likes to just go to
these rocks which in the evenings and mornings are
undisturbed. Usually he parks his motorbike near these rocks and get
on with his work. Although the purpose of his going there is to
sunbathe or do some exercise on the road shoulder (I still don&amp;rsquo;t
understand why he shows a preference for such a spot do do this), he
first scans the rocks for empty liquor bottles left behind by careless
drinkers. He goes over and picks them up giving an impression that he
might actually do the place a service. The very first thing heard is
the sound of glass shattering. Sometimes pieces of the shattered
bottle hit you, if you&amp;rsquo;re close enough. Then one can hear the laughter
of satisfaction. I once told him (sarcastically, but convincingly)
that glass is the same as sand in its chemical composition, expecting
him to be overjoyed but he was completely unconcerned. Just mildly
amused. He went about doing his social service, sometimes with a
little creativity: he would rest the bottle on the rock and fling a
stone the size of a clenched fist or even larger at it and watch in
satisfaction as the bottle fragmented. Another time he flung a small
hard bottle against a larger fragile bottle and merrily witnessed the
results. Even large pieces of glass upset him. He crushes those
underfoot. I did try explaining to him that there are a lot of
animals that live near these rocks and that his breaking those bottles
does them anything but good. He shrugged this off as he did with the
case of plastics.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-scam-that-is-waste-disposal">The scam that is waste disposal&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The school that we live in has, over the years, transformed waste
disposal into a systematic process wherein the separation of different
types of refuse is integral. It is very evident that without this,
piles of accumulating waste attract domestic pests, pollute the place
rather than anything else and on the whole make it extremely
unpleasant and hazardous to not only human but also other
life. Organic refuse can be composted, plastics and glass can be
reused and metal can be recycled. However:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What &lt;em>yaar Biggibee&lt;/em>! All these &lt;strong>&lt;strong>&lt;strong>&lt;strong>*&lt;/strong>&lt;/strong>&lt;/strong>&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>&lt;strong>*&lt;/strong>&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>&lt;strong>*&lt;/strong>&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>&lt;strong>**&lt;/strong>&lt;/strong> [names withheld
for various reasons] simply bought four-four new dustbins &lt;em>yaar&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>His stock of old soft drink bottles (all plastic), soft drink
tetra-packs, plastic shopping bags, kitchen wastes (often including
packaging, plastic of course), and almost anything else is bundled
into a large polyethylene bag and dumped randomly into any one of the
four dustbins provided. Franky, at this stage, I&amp;rsquo;m not shocked or
anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>His obsession for soft drinks is now a die hard habit. Purportedly,
soft drinks are far better than the drinking water provided here for
the reason that the water (as opposed to soft drinks such as &lt;em>Coke&lt;/em>,
&lt;em>Thums up&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Appy Fizz&lt;/em>, etc) makes him fat. Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ll admit the water
here is hard, but that signifies nothing! Aerated drinks, such as
those he&amp;rsquo;s shown a preference for, are but concentrated sugar and
carbon dioxide! (I am very seriously considering writing a character
analysis about him as we used to in school about characters in plays!)
Getting back to the topic at hand, he buys these not in large bottles
but in small plastic tetra-packs and tin cans. When asked what he does
with these, he once said that he keeps them after use and uses them to
drink from rather than using large bottles. That is something that not
just I but several others would disapprove of, and on various
levels. In any case, he does not do what he says he does as you would
have expected. He disposes of them as I described above.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="i-only-let-what-i-want-inside-my-house">I only let what I want inside my house&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Knowing that a long line of interns and volunteers have been
conducting a project on a lizard species here, he often used to ask me
if any of them would like to catch lizards in his house, since their
job was to catch lizards anyway. Attempts at explaining that the
species of lizard that they study is so vastly different are futile as
that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean anything to him. Although this is said lightly, this
tendency of his is of interest and I may write of it elsewhere. His
descriptions of the menace cause by the lizards is often very
humorous.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>These lizards, no, they put their dung everywhere.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>What dung? I ask, seriously wondering what on earth he&amp;rsquo;s talking
about.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Arre yaar&lt;/em>! Their shit!&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t bother any further. I don&amp;rsquo;t understand what those lizards have
done to him that he hasn&amp;rsquo;t himself! It turned out that, as I found out
much later, he had bought a toy gun that actually shot at fairly high
speeds small plastic balls and a laser pointer with which he used to
accurately shoot these house lizards to death. When someone is
stubborn and hell-bent on doing something so ridiculously elaborate,
I&amp;rsquo;ve found out that, more often than not, its best to let them do as
they wish.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Amphibians are the other unwelcome guests to his house. Toads that
usually migrate towards anywhere that they get more food, such as
under a light source, migrate to the top of the stairs to his door
where he keeps his shoes. Somehow, these toads climb into his shoes
and stay there until he accidentally touches them while putting on his
shoes. Once this has happened, he empties the shoe over the stairs,
dropping the toad a whole story down. Once he has worn the shoes, he
then picks up a bamboo stick (which I&amp;rsquo;ve seen him use only in the way
mentioned) and on finding the toad nails it to a concrete or stone
surface with the stick and crushes it. You can almost guess his
answer when asked what he&amp;rsquo;s doing that for:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Arre&lt;/em> this frog is simply coming into my shoe. I will teach it not to
do it again.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>How can you teach a toad (not a frog) by crushing it?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Arre&lt;/em> if I hit it, it will not come back.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Yeah, well, I can&amp;rsquo;t argue with that logic can I?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="consequences-of-this-mindset">Consequences of this mindset&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A whole country thinking this way only makes things harder for
implementing sustainable policy. Even the best of governmental policy
if not understood by the people, comes to no good. What the best
school in the country has failed to do is to educate such people about
such issues and that definitely doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound good. I do not intend to
pin the blame on any one, least of all the school, but it is these
antisocial elements that spread negative influence and why this
mindset still prevails, as did happen with the &lt;em>Jallikattu&lt;/em>
protests. What I have described here is a limited perspective of the
bigger issue at hand, the same that probably took the &lt;em>Jallikattu&lt;/em>
protests forward to the large scale that it achieved. That I will be
talking about in another article. Indiscriminate killing of wildlife,
damaging wildlife irreversibly alters the interactions between species
which are a fundamental requirement of ecosystem maintenance. Hence
sustainability goes out of the window as soon as one meddles with
other life forms. That is not saying much because human existence
today already causes so much interference with pre-existing life
forms. It can hardy get worse, and this I say not in a positive
way. If anything, human should strive to reduce unnecessary contact
with wildlife that can potentially damage it. That was about the
effects of direct interference. Improper waste management,
unsustainable practices and other such contribute to indirect
effects. The indirect effects have already caused significant
damage. If it isn&amp;rsquo;t realised immediately, as should the issue of
global warming (which the world&amp;rsquo;s biggest superpower ignores so
conveniently) it is inevitable that the apocalypse will occur. The
only cure to this is a scientific or methodical approach to thought
which I have written about in the first part of the essay on
evolution. I may have missed our several aspect so these issues and
probably even some important ones. I hope to cover those in the other
articles that should be up later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Misunderstanding evolution</title><link>https://peregrinator.site/blog/2017/02/misunderstanding-evolution/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://peregrinator.site/blog/2017/02/misunderstanding-evolution/</guid><description>&lt;p>Who does really understand evolution? (Wait, is it even true?!) Even
if it is, who really has the better idea? What the hell did Darwin
really do on the &lt;em>Beagle&lt;/em>? Well, I have some answers. In this
two-part essay, I will be discussing how to understand evolution as a
concept and will be touching upon the babble behind the scenes. This
part is a general background to the concept of evolution, dealing with
the &amp;ldquo;story&amp;rdquo; behind it rather than the concepts themselves. The second
part will deal with the theories of evolution and their finer
aspects.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When I was in school, I found that a lot of the concepts that I
thought I understood were actually more complicated. Obviously, I had
to wait till the exams to realise this. But then, I figured that if I
could understand what went wrong at that time, anyone could, and
additionally prepare in such a way that they really understand the
concept as a whole, in all its finer aspects. What hampers such
precise understanding of facts is assumptions and
expectations. Spiritual predispositions and other such forces tend to
cloud judgement and, hence, come in the way of logical thought. The
other most significant antagonist of scientific thought is (and I
don&amp;rsquo;t mean the kind of thought that religious people lack!) the
undoubting faith in whatever is told. The inability to question and be
skeptical. Now, this might sound weird. It certainly did feel weird
when I realised this. But I believe that by the end of this essay, it
will be well established that skepticism is the key element to
understanding anything. Please note, I intend no animosity towards
spirituality and any comments made in this essay are purely
light-hearted.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setting-the-stage">Setting the stage&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Most readers would have come across textbooks that describe evolution
with the usual theories and examples. There is Lamarck&amp;rsquo;s theory, which
in most opinions, is outdated and eclipsed by the more robust and
logical Darwinian ideas. Then come the modern theories of Morgan and
others who using Mendel&amp;rsquo;s [then] recently rediscovered ideas, further
complicated things. Well, brush all those aside! Throw them out of
your head! Science is also about starting afresh once things get
muddled up!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-are-we-talking-about">What are we talking about?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The misconceptions that are associated with evolution are what the
mind has to consciously rid itself off. Why these are present in the
first place is another topic altogether which I&amp;rsquo;m afraid I can&amp;rsquo;t talk
about (since it just isn&amp;rsquo;t my cup of tea, yet!) and involves
understanding the functioning of the mind. Suffice it to say that the
mind tends to simplify facts and hence colour the explanation that one
receives when trying to understand a concept. The end result is an
inaccurate understanding of concepts which a good skeptic sees through
when examined finely. These misconceptions I will lay bare here
and it must be noted that only once these are understood will the
concepts I explain make sense.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="1-dot-time-frames">1. Time frames&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The underlying processes of evolution have been observed to act over
great expanses of time. The study of fossils (Palaeontology) has had a
very important role to play in the development of evolution as a
concept. Darwin&amp;rsquo;s observations of fossils apart by millions of
years played a crucial role in his understanding of his own
concepts. Fossils are by no means easily found and this highlights the
fact that they are formed in very rare cases. This inherently implies
the period in between formation of two fossils of any kind is
great. In addition to this, their discovery is fraught with
complications that for the purposes of this essay needn&amp;rsquo;t be
elaborated. The end result: fossils found are from times so wide apart
that any changes seem obvious.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those of you that have seen the film &lt;em>The Man from Earth&lt;/em>, would have an
idea as to what (spoiler alert!!) someone who lived for fourteen
thousand years would have experienced in a life so long. But the
common man would find it challenging to comprehend even those time
scales involved. Although I could go on about timescales, I&amp;rsquo;d rather
get to the main idea of the talk earlier so I&amp;rsquo;ll share a much-clichéd
analogy to make this concept clear.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If you represent the Earth’s lifetime by a single year, say from
January when it was made to December, the 21st-century would be a
quarter of a second in June – a tiny fraction of the year. But even in
this concertinaed cosmic perspective, our century is very, very
special: the first when humans can change themselves and their home
planet….&lt;/p>
&lt;p>… let’s suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the
cosmos from afar, not just for 40 years, but for the entire 4.5
billion-year history of our Earth. What would they have seen? Over
nearly all that immense time, Earth’s appearance would have changed
very gradually.The only abrupt worldwide change would have been major
asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions. Apart from those brief
traumas, nothing happens suddenly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The continental landmasses drifted around. Ice cover waxed and
waned. Successions of new species emerged, evolved and became
extinct. But in just a tiny sliver of the Earth’s history, the last
one-millionth part, a few thousand years, the patterns of vegetation
altered much faster than before. This signaled the start of
agriculture.Change has accelerated as human populations rose. Then
other things happened even more abruptly. Within just 50 years —
that’s one hundredth of one millionth of the Earth’s age — the amount
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise, and ominously
fast…&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This explanation illustrates the time periods that have shaped
the earth. Human presence graced the earth for so short a period that
what we see in the world today is exceedingly limited. Those are the
timescales that evolution acts over.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2-dot-generational-factors">2. Generational factors&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A very frequently misunderstood aspect of evolution is the strata of
organisms evolution affects. This is closely linked to the first
miscalculation of time frames as you shall see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most common idea the people have is that evolution occurs in the
individual. The &amp;ldquo;learnings&amp;rdquo; of one individual are directly transferred
to their offspring. This is anything but true. Evolution happens over
several generations of individuals. And evolution is more of a
consequence of other changes; individuals of a population don&amp;rsquo;t change
as a result of evolution. Their offspring accumulate changes over
generations that lead to the evolution of a species.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="3-dot-evolution-is-not-progress">3. Evolution is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> progress&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Although there might be evidence of better &lt;em>adaptation&lt;/em> to certain
environmental factors, there is &lt;strong>no&lt;/strong> &lt;em>progress&lt;/em> that
occurs as a result of evolution. The whole theory that man is the most
advanced being on this planet isn&amp;rsquo;t entirely true. Evidences of
alternative forms of intelligence exist in other life forms, and
although these may not be on par with &lt;em>intelligence&lt;/em> as defined by a
human, they certainly are nearly as good in their own way. I won&amp;rsquo;t say
any more about this because this isn&amp;rsquo;t the point I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make in
any case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Evolution is caused by selective survival of individuals
&lt;em>better capable&lt;/em> of surviving in a very specific environment. This only
means that the animal is better capable of surviving in that
environment than say others of its original population. It must be
noted that this I&amp;rsquo;ve only given as a comparison. The two would
interact only if members of the original population still survive, and
if they co-occur or are sympatric (in scientific terms), the added
constraint of limited resources (amongst other factors) would result
in the extermination of the lesser able (that is members of the
original population). The so-called &amp;ldquo;struggle for life&amp;rdquo; is only
metaphorical; animals don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily fight each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="4-dot-when-evolution-occurred">4. When evolution occurred&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Evolution has occurred in the past, is occurring now, and will
continue to occur in the future. This is commonly confounded by the
belief that evolution has occurred and the animals and plants seen
today are the final products of all evolution that has ever
occurred. This gives evolution a &amp;ldquo;creational&amp;rdquo; position, more or less
equal to &amp;ldquo;God&amp;rdquo;. And that is where science differs from God!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Evolution occurs continually because there some parts of the
environment that continually change and to &amp;ldquo;keep up&amp;rdquo; with those,
certain individuals of populations are selected out. This also affects
all species on earth. The same species that we see today may not
exist in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="5-dot-evolution-as-a-fact">5. Evolution as a fact&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you think the theories of evolution are fact, that&amp;rsquo;s great! Only
they&amp;rsquo;re not. Like all good theories in science, these can only
something that can be shown to be true in very specific cases, with
&lt;em>some amount of certainty&lt;/em> (yes, the theories have not been proven as a
fact &lt;em>yet&lt;/em>, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t got that already!). As they say in science, a
good theory is one that stands the test of time and
experimentation. Fortunately, for you believers out there,
evolutionary theory has stood the test of time so far. But remember,
that this doesn&amp;rsquo;t give any reason to doubt the theory. The theories of
evolution make clear many of the &amp;ldquo;unexplainable&amp;rdquo; happenings of the
world. I will not be discussing that aspect since I believe that can
be done once you&amp;rsquo;ve understood the concept of evolution itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="darwin-s-influences">Darwin&amp;rsquo;s influences&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before getting to the theory itself, I feel it would be of good use to
look at the story of Darwin and evolutionary theory. But let me get
one thing clear before I start with even this: the &amp;ldquo;Darwinian&amp;rdquo; theory
of evolution was not Darwin&amp;rsquo;s own. He was too dull-witted to think up
the whole thing himself. What he effectively did was compile
everything at hand and publish it. Even the idea that he should do
this was not his own! It might make more sense, hence, to think of
this as the people or ideas that made him sure enough to write about
it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; Darwin was actually quite imperceptive. His was a very mundane
life and although he had planned on studying medicine, he switched
over to the cloth and learned the scriptures instead and this might
have played an important role in shaping his thought. He had access to
several books in the library and even read some &amp;ldquo;prohibited&amp;rdquo; books
(those books which the clergy thought would endanger their popularity
by getting people interested in science). One such was the &lt;em>Principles
of Geology&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, there are the well-known books that he
carried with him on the voyage of the HMS &lt;em>Beagle&lt;/em>: John
Milton&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Paradise Lost&lt;/em> and Charles Lyell&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Principles of Geology&lt;/em>. Very
simply, the graphic descriptions of living creatures and the
fascination for them expressed in &lt;em>Paradise Lost&lt;/em> and the &lt;em>Principles of
Geology&lt;/em> got him thinking about world changing changes that take place
over periods of large amounts of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another major influence may have been his grandfather himself. Erasmus
Darwin was a physician and also a poet amongst several other
things. In his poems (&lt;em>The Loves of the Plants&lt;/em> and &lt;em>The Temple of
Nature&lt;/em>, it is said that there are mentions of evolution in a similar
capacity to what Darwin spoke of in his &lt;em>Origin&lt;/em>. Darwin&amp;rsquo;s own teacher,
Robert Edmond Grant was said to have purported the same theory and had
been considered &amp;ldquo;heretic&amp;rdquo; by Darwin and others of that time. Although
Grant had recieved fame worldwide for his other work, his theory
brought down upon him disdain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So carrying Milton and Lyell, Darwin finally left on the voyage of the
&lt;em>Beagle&lt;/em>, at the crisp age of 22, as an unpaid gentleman&amp;rsquo;s companion
(I&amp;rsquo;m sorry but that sounds a lot worse than what it is intended to!)
to the [then] also young Captain Robert FitzRoy. It is suggested that
his predecessor on the &lt;em>Beagle&lt;/em> had committed suicide as a consequence
of &amp;ldquo;loneliness&amp;rdquo;. I am told Darwin got to travel with the &lt;em>Beagle&lt;/em> only
because he had the right shape of the nose. Four years later, they
landed on the Galápagos Islands hoping to find of all things Giant
Tortoises to eat! What happened next was history. Or rather, what
happened became history only after several years because Darwin was
dumb.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A dark side to pets</title><link>https://peregrinator.site/blog/2016/01/a-dark-side-to-pets/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://peregrinator.site/blog/2016/01/a-dark-side-to-pets/</guid><description>&lt;p>We all love cats, but are they really what we believe them to be? A
common perception is that cats are lazy animals and prefer sleeping
though most of the day. But has anyone actually seen a cat hunt? Their
feline agility coupled with a primal necessity to kill make for an
extremely dangerous animal to keep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have any of you wondered what feral cats and many domestic cats do at
night? Take a look at the leopard. Many of you would have read Jim
Corbett&amp;rsquo;s stories. One particular book comes to mind: &amp;lsquo;The Man-eating
Leopard of Rudraprayag&amp;rsquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s a fairly small book that describes a
leopard whose usual haunts were the villages around Rudraprayag in
what is now Uttarakhand, Northern India. The man-eater was notorious
for having killed over a hundred and twenty-five people in its
&amp;ldquo;career&amp;rdquo; as Corbett describes it. What is most interesting about the
kills was that not a single one took place in daylight. Felids are
nocturnal and hence most of the hunting takes place in the
dark. Similarly, most feral and domesticated cats are active at night
and that&amp;rsquo;s when most of the hunting happens.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://peregrinator.site/images/20161201_goose_catsnake.jpg"
 alt="Grey and white tabby cat killing a small snake">&lt;figcaption>
 &lt;p>Goose I in the process of killing a cat snake&lt;/p>
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>

&lt;p>On the first of December 2016, I was sitting at home in. My father
said something which at first I ignored. Then, realising that he&amp;rsquo;d
said Goose (my cat) was killing a snake. I rushed out to see that a
small brown snake was dangling from Goose&amp;rsquo;s mouth and was struggling
to escape. Goose then dropped it and picked it up to get a better
grip. It was my mother who suggested I save the snake. It took me a
while to get to my senses by which time Goose had inflicted a deep cut
into the snake&amp;rsquo;s body. I tried pulling Goose away but was a little
worried about getting scratched and bitten. It was futile and Goose
was surprisingly intensely focused (which he usually is not) and
intent on devouring the ophidian. I asked my mother to get some food
for him from the kitchen while I tried to pull him away. It was only
after cutting the snake in half that he finally let go. There was
nothing left to be done and I kept the corpse aside to identify.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What happened while trying to identify it is another story for another
day I found out that it was a Yellow-Green Cat Snake (&lt;em>Boiga
flaviviridis&lt;/em> Vogel and Ganesh, 2013). Goose, by then, has eaten the
rear half of the cat snake and disappeared. But what surprised me the
most was that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know of this side of Goose or of his predatory
instincts as well as I thought I did. I was, of course, furious at the
fact that he&amp;rsquo;d killed a snake, but then what next? Should I continue
feeding him?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-docile-cat">A docile cat?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Goose was brought up by my neighbours. He was something of a small guy
and smaller than most of the other cats around. He was fed rice and
milk with occasional curds but never meat. He was very social and
friendly and had no issues with being petted. He was so friendly that
he would climb up onto our laps and sleep. Since he was isolated from
his mother, who typically would have taught him all the necessary
skills to hunt, and also seemed to only sleep all day, I began to
think he couldn&amp;rsquo;t hunt and get the right nutrition to grow up. I was
convinced of this when he showed absolutely no interest in birds on
the ground or in low bushes. Lizards, insects, and spiders were bold
in his presence because he just refused to go after them. I usually
had to wave spiders in his face for him to get interested in them, and
even then he was a clumsy hunter. And for nearly 2 years I was
convinced that Goose was the ideal pet. I had, of course, heard of
feral cats hunting and killing, just for the joy of it, wild rodents,
birds, lizards, and snakes. One of my friends did mention observing a
full grown cat taking on a cobra. But Goose was different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seeing Goose kill the snake came as a nasty surprise to me. Even now
as I write this I am unable to wrap my head around the irony of a cat
killing a cat snake. Some days later my father told me that he&amp;rsquo;d seen
Goose carrying a large mouse, and as usual, he &amp;ldquo;showed off&amp;rdquo; his
(s)kill by dropping it at the doorstep.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hunting-but-it-doesn-t-stop-there">Hunting, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For three reasons, cats and dogs are more successful at establishing
themselves over native predators. Cats are protected from disease, not
limited by the availability of prey, and least of all limited in
numbers by territoriality. They are also immensely successful in
places like islands and other naturally predator-free landscapes,
where native wildlife has close to no adaptations to help avoid
becoming prey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Patterns of cats hunting wildlife have been well documented. In the
United States itself, some 12.3 billion mammals and 2.4 billion birds
are lost to free ranging pets and feral cats every year. There have
been innumerable instances of this behaviour in cats from around the
world, and animal protection societies frequently suggest keeping cats
locked indoors at night or when most wild animals are active (see
references for more). Naturalists and conservationists all over the
world urge pet keepers to stay informed of their pet&amp;rsquo;s movements and
ensure that they are well fed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other issues with free-ranging carnivorous animals are that they carry
vastly novel diseases that wild animals they come in close contact
with are unlikely to have been exposed to. These typically transmit
from humans and other domestic animals such as cattle. Fragmented
forest patches often have an inadequate reserves of food for the
wildlife in it. Animals such as elephants are forced out and to use
the food grown in crops such as banana plantations and
sugarcane. Carnivores, due to lack of food venture into human
habitation for food and are forced to interact with these feral
animals, from which the diseases are more easily obtained. With
prevalent fragmentation of forests, wild animals, especially those
that live in closed social groups such as macaques and Wild Dogs, get
restricted to fragments and hence are more susceptible to epidemics of
these diseases. Added to this, certain carnivorous cat species that
have very low genetic diversity, can suffer a lot of damage with the
added impact of these introduced diseases. Asiatic lions in Gir are a
single isolated population and even a few lions contracting something
like canine distemper could potentially wipe out the entire
population.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stray and feral dogs that are a very common sight in cities and towns
not only pose a health hazard to humans by spreading rabies and other
diseases but also attack and kill children. Adults aren&amp;rsquo;t spared from
brutal attacks either. Dogs are known to regularly hunt Black-naped
Hares and other small mammals. Stray dogs at the IIT Madras campus
have been reported to hunt Spotted Deer and on occasion even the
endangered Blackbuck. Despite measures taken to capture and relocate
dogs from inside the campus, a large number of them are hard to catch
and remain in the wilderness. Regardless of such efforts, stray dogs
continue to migrate in and out of such places and there&amp;rsquo;s almost no
shortage of them at any given point of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Islands are prime examples for cats hunting a species to
extinction. The best known example of this is the Stephens Island
Wren. The case of the Rockwren was very similar to that of the dodo in
the sense that they were found only on a small island. There was a
light-house on that island and three keepers lived on the island with
their families and a tutor for their children. One or more cats were
kept by these families and a cat, known as Tibbles, was notorious for
having hunted in its career all the endemic Stephens Island Wren
(&lt;em>Traversia lyalli&lt;/em>). It is said that the bird went extinct,
while it was being discovered for the first time by one of the keepers
of the lighthouse. Although this may not be the complete story, it
serves as an example of how invasive feral carnivores can destroy
native ecosystems. As I have mentioned earlier this isn&amp;rsquo;t the complete
story. I will be writing more about this particular case in a later
article.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>New Zealand is also home to a very unique series of reptiles not found
anywhere around the globe. Several species have gone extinct in the
few thousand years it has been occupied by human beings. There was
another cat in whose 17 years of life, it hunted over 558 recorded
animals of which 223 were birds. Although the birds survived, the cat
is known to have exterminated all the rabbits which it later seemed to
prefer. It, however, must be noted that it was not merely cats that
were involved in these extinctions but also household pests that
accompanied humans onto the islands that played a crucial role.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="last-words-responsible-pet-ownership">Last words: responsible pet ownership&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What next? I think the key point to be kept in mind here is
responsible pet ownership. This is a discussion riddled in ambiguous
ethical principles and accountability is almost never
considered. Legal restrictions and various problematic policies on
dealing with the issue make it harder to address. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to
discuss this aspect of the issue in another post.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ahab</title><link>https://peregrinator.site/fiction/2012/05/ahab/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2012 21:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://peregrinator.site/fiction/2012/05/ahab/</guid><description>&lt;p>The disturbed man woke from violent sleep. He wondered to himself of
the soundness of his reasons for absence from the deck. His
illness. The numerous days that were spent in solitude were of good
use to him but wasn&amp;rsquo;t there a better and simpler way of achieving such
a thing as confidence? One evasive whale and a megalomaniac at its
ghostly tail. If there existed such means, could he have employed it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He toyed with the three month old locks that fell from his pale scalp
unkempt. An older beard lined the jaw on an even paler face. He looked
at his hands - sinewy and covered with veins that carried blood full
of stale air. His gnarled fingernails were black with permanently
implanted fragments of meat and dirt from the incessant scratching of
the rash, another of his alleged illnesses. Ever since that stump had
been rectified with a wooden prosthesis, a rash had erupted on the
skin of the stump. He suddenly reached out as if to pluck out the
wooden aid but settled for scratching the rash, with more fervour than
before, which in turn immediately turned red hot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He cursed out aloud. The reverberations died down as suddenly as they
had begun. He straightened his legs off the hammock and stood up
precariously. He walked up to the section of wall where his pistols
hung, brown with rust and uncared for. He removed the nearest he could
grasp from its nail and hobbled back to the hammock. The three months
of rest had not healed his stump, even slightly. The pain rose and
fell in cycles and eventually numbed out. He clasped the handle of the
pistol in his grubby hands and raised it to his head when suddenly he
heard a faint almost inaudible knock. Despite the nimbleness of the
knock, in the undisturbed silence of the room, it sounded
disproportionately loud and sharp. The hand holding the pistol
wavered, only for a moment, and the metal hit his ear as it fell. It
hit his shoulder and then plonked to the hammock.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Who is it?&amp;rsquo; he growled in a low monotone. There was no reply. He
asked again, raising his voice. There was no response,
yet. Exasperated, he shouted the question.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Stubb, skipper!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Enter!&amp;rsquo; Ahab said and the door opened to reveal a clean shaven man of
about thirty years of age. His scalp was hairless. He was short and as
if in lieu of that deficit, his thighs and calves along with his
shoulders and biceps were abnormally large. The neck was that of a
bear&amp;rsquo;s and appeared an extension of his head. Tremendous volumes of
hair erupted from his shirt sleeves, that were folded up to the
biceps, and from his neck. The shirt was without a collar and tight
fitting. Where its first two buttons failed to find their button holes
was a hirsute man. A brute he was, thought Ahab, even that voice was
suchlike. He put the pistol elsewhere and adjusted the wooden leg.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Sir, I have a request from the crew&amp;rsquo; Stubb began.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;Speak for yourself&amp;rsquo; Ahab cut in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;You must be beyond insane,&amp;rsquo; Stubb said, &amp;rsquo;to proclaim so surely that
we hunt down Moby Dick alone.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Noticing the lamp on the wall, adjacent to the hammock, flickering,
Ahab said as though Stubb hadn&amp;rsquo;t spoken at all. &amp;lsquo;Help that lamp live
for a while longer. Pour it some oil, dog.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;I will not be spoken to with slurs of the like&amp;rsquo; Stubb said after
gathering the most composed demeanour the two insults would let him
afford. One would turn into a pile of bones and skin, both broken, if
he was spoken to in such a manner. Ahab countered: &amp;lsquo;Then you are no
better than a plumped swine. Attend to that lamp you cursed mongrel.&amp;rsquo;
There was calm before the storm. Then it came, red faced and cloth
tearing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;lsquo;&lt;em>You&lt;/em> are cursed, Ahab. &lt;em>You&lt;/em> are hell bent on doing the impossible and
you have a crew hoodwinked to come to your aid. Whalery they say,
unaware of what they&amp;rsquo;re out at sea for. Have you signed a pact with
the White Whale himself? So he can quench his thirst for the rest of
your and our blood?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The shouts rang out for moments before the reverberations died down.
Calm as ever, Ahab requested Stubb to leave. The other, tensed and
ready to strike at Ahab, refused. At this Ahab raised his pistol from
beside him and repeated the request. With much anger suppressed and
reluctance, the door of the cabin was opened and with its closing
departed Stubb.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Picking up an oilcan, Ahab staggered to the dying lamp and refilled
the receptacle. Painfully aware of the overwhelming ache in his
thigh-stump, he managed the few steps to the hammock. He cleared it of
is contents and lay down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As his hold over his thoughts returned, he contemplated for a few
moments what Stubb had said. Had his own days of isolation impacted
his cognitive abilities? He probably should change his mind about Moby
Dick. After all they were a whaling crew in the business of whaling
and not merely marionettes driven by revenge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But then what did that make him? Mediocre and spineless? Cowardly for
having exiled himself from the crew? Was his life an embodiment of
hopelessness? What had become of him after that shoddy and vile fight
with his wife? She probably was accurate about the monomania and
stupidity of his. What had become of her - a whore? He had spent his
younger days with her before losing himself in whaling, and in those
ephemeral shore days between his whaling voyages. The last stretch of
time about her was in the time only days before the voyage of the
Pequod had begun. Her, with whom he had raised a daughter and
son. Where were they? If anything more than a withering memory already
in fragments, what had become of them?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A sudden pang of thirst had him unconsciously reaching out to the
empty mug. The odour of the drink kept on the table guided his other
hand to its source. It was uncorked. The thoughts that occupied his
mind make pouring the drink into the horn a challenge. Instead, drops
from the flowing bitter liquid fell to the table and the spray was
thrown at his face. He startled and regained consciousness and moved
the mug to where the liquor fell on the table. It filled briefly. Now
again half-conscious, he brought the liquor to his lips and let the
intoxicant run down the length of his tongue into his parched
throat. The warm trickle inside was in stark contrast to the cold of
the splattering of the same on his face. He wiped the spray from his
face roughly with the sleeve of his shirt.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The cold of the evening was beginning to lose its vigour. The single
window on the bare walls was suddenly thrown open. The shutter was
wrenched open, its stopper sheared clean off, and the cold wind, thick
with moisture from the salt ridden seas found its way through. The
incessant gale eventually unhinged the shutter and dropped it onto the
wooden floor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The lone occupant of the hammock had by then drained the remnants of a
second liquor bottle. The black glass of the bottle lay in shards on
the floor. There was no one to attend to it. Nor to the shutter for
the occupant of the cabin lay in the hammock, unwilling to rise. The
movements of the ship was in synchrony with the sway of the
hammock. Its user was once again left to his disturbed sleep.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>The dream was of himself riding on a whaling boat at the bow. He could
see his shipmates rowing but their faces he couldn&amp;rsquo;t
recognise. Blurred as they were, he ignored them and turned to the
mighty whale that they were in pursuit of. Its immense hoary tail was
not more than fifteen yards away. He moved to the back of the boat and
pulled out one of the three harpoons, its line was uncoiled. It was
thrown.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within the next couple of moments the boat began moving faster. The
seasickness in him worked its way through the weather beaten skin and
conquered his watery soul. The bitter taste in his mouth gave way.
Seconds later, he was heaving and involuntarily began to hurl the
contents of his intestines and stomach into the sea that frothed in
the whale&amp;rsquo;s wake. It was either a wave or a tug from the hoary
leviathan but Ahab and his lean, illness-ridden body was flung into
the mouth of a whirling mass of water. He couldn&amp;rsquo;t swim. Nor could he
feel the wooden prosthetic. The daylight faded and the water enclosed
him in its deceptive calm and then he jerked awake lying in a puddle
of regurgitated liquor and food. It was frozen. The stump ended at
the knee. The matter hair and beard were a tangled disorderly
sight.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>about me</title><link>https://peregrinator.site/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peregrinator.site/about/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-does-peregrinator-mean">What does &lt;em>peregrinator&lt;/em> mean?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Peregrinator&lt;/em> refers to one of two things, both of which I had in mind
while selecting the name. I had initially wanted to go with
Lammergeier (the German name for the &lt;a href="https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/lammer1/cur/introduction">Bearded Vulture&lt;/a>) but then it was
taken on most platforms. &lt;em>Peregrinator&lt;/em> is the subspecies name for the
Shaheen Falcon (&lt;em>&lt;a href="https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/perfal/cur/systematics#subsp">Falco peregrinus peregrinator&lt;/a>&lt;/em> — you might have to
scroll down here.) It is a beautiful falcon with a dark back and
upper-wings, a white throat, and vivid rufous underparts. It has a
typical dark &amp;ldquo;helmet&amp;rdquo; as seen in the photo. Juveniles have incomplete
hemlets and are a paler shade of rufous. Shaheen Bagh also happens to
be the name of the place chosen by the people protesting the unjust
implementation of the CAA and NRC in 2019. The word &lt;em>peregrinator&lt;/em>
itself comes from Latin and is synonymous with &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/peregrinator">traveller or wanderer&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a 29 year old, neurodivergent, cat person who sometimes cosplays
as an ecologist. I&amp;rsquo;m big on F(L)OSS and currently run a &lt;a href="https://voidlinux.org">Void Linux&lt;/a>
installation with the pure-gtk version of Emacs 30. I also play the
guitar, listen to typically a lot of metal and try to make my own
music occasionally. I currently use &lt;a href="https://ardour.org">Ardour 7.0&lt;/a> for audio production,
which I&amp;rsquo;m very new to, and hope to get started with the &lt;a href="https://sonic-pi.net">Sonic Pi&lt;/a> as
both a standalone instrument as well as a synth for instruments I
don&amp;rsquo;t play myself. I also travel a lot for work and end up visiting a
lot of new places while I&amp;rsquo;m working. I will be starting working on
maintaining a log of that too sometime soon on this blog. Especially
the birding reports with links to eBird checklists since I&amp;rsquo;m in the
habit of maintaining them.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have a cat at home and she&amp;rsquo;s called Goose V. Goose the Fifth since
there have been four &amp;ldquo;Geese&amp;rdquo; before her. She&amp;rsquo;s predominantly a stray
that just comes and hangs out at our place, but I hope to adopt her
soon. She loves to be indoors, especially in the winters since it gets
cold and she needs additional warmth. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t mind jumping up next
to me on the chair or on the bed even. At night sometimes, she even
likes to sleep next to me. She&amp;rsquo;s a talkative cat and often gets very
aggressive with the head bumps and the purring. She does get quite
loud too at times, especially when I pet her on her lower back, which
she loves, incidentally. Occasionally, shes so calm that she lets me
scratch her belly too, and this is rare apparently.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is a &lt;em>static&lt;/em> website and is intended to be the home for my blog,
Emacs configuration and work updates. The blog is written and entirely
works out of my Emacs! Everything you see here was written in &lt;a href="https:orgmode.org">Org-mode&lt;/a>
on Emacs, exported to markdown via &lt;a href="https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo">ox-hugo&lt;/a> for better compatibility -

&lt;p>I initially used a very basic blog-centric layout based off the &lt;a href="https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch/">Etch&lt;/a>
theme, a simple dark theme with just a list of posts on the homepage.
In 2023, I switched to a theme-agnostic setup based on &lt;a href="https://drewdevault.com">Drew Devault&amp;rsquo;s
blog&lt;/a> because it just looked so good in a ridiculously minimal sense
that appeals only to someone a little obsessively retro. This served
me well and I had published this as a Sourcehut page. It took me until
early this year to switch to this domain. and I have since moved to a
personalised version of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/jpanther/congo">Congo&lt;/a> theme. The source for this website
is on my &lt;a href="https://github.com/brihadeesh/peregrinator.site">Github&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://git.sr.ht/~peregrinator/emacs.peregrinator.site">Sourcehut&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
